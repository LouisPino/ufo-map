On the evening of July 31, 2000 I was travelling south on I295 between Richmond, VA and Petersburg, VA, with 1 passenger.  It was very dark and stormy and about 9 p.m..  The two of us observed what appeared to be a very large, neon-green fireball travelling south parallel to I295 at what appeared to be treetop level.  It was travelling faster than the highway traffic, probably at 200 miles per hour or so.  The lower third of it was hidden by the treetops.  It did not have a long tail, but could have had a very short tail.  Its surface appeared to have a lot of clear-colored small bubbles associated with it.  Its size was comparable to a lemon held at arm's length.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  After thinking about it for several months, I considered the possibility that it might be a UFO.  The reasons for this are as follows: 1) it was travelling parallel to the ground, not arcing down; 2) it did not have a well-defined tail; 3) it appeared very large, and appeared to be at a very low altitude.  I am a geologist (PhD) and I knew that if a bolide of this size and scale hit the earth, it would cause a catastrophic event.  I figured that astronomers would have noticed it and reported on it. I heard nothing reported. The alternative explanation is that we were looking at the base or side of a UFO.  Since I do not know if you received my last report, please notify me when you  receive this.  My passenger was a 10 year old boy.  If the object was a meteor, it was gargantuan in scale, and looked like a planet speeding past.  Near Richmond airport.",

I do not recall the exact property, but looking at a map, and recalling a brook that passed through the farm, I would say that I was on the south side of Rte 253 right where the brook crosses 253.  After a day of helping around the farm, just after dark, I was sitting leisurely on the grass against an embankment  facing the highway.  The hill I was leaning against sets back about 3-400 yds from the road. I was chatting with a young lady that joined me there as a guest. I was 19 and she was about 24.  As we spoke I noticed what appeared to be the wing lights of a small plane, above the hills which are beyond the highway. The lights looked to be about a mile or so away at that time. The lights came directly over the road and over the farm toward us. They took quite a while (perhaps 5 minutes)to reach the farm area and by that time I had surprisingly noticed that there was nothing but space between the two lights.  A plane that travels at 60 mph would have taken only a minute to get to us.  They were glowing a subdued dark orange, were about 12-15 feet in diameter with maybe 40 feet separating them. They were not discs, but were spherical.  They made an almost inaudible crackling noise like static electricity and appeared that way too. The two balls went directly over our heads perfectly parallel and side-by-side bearly skimming over the hill I had been leaning against, which is to my memory, about 2-300 ft up. They passed over us without slowing down, but they were moving at only about 10 mph.  Immediately trailing the two spheres were like a static-y charge, like a kind of faint sparkle. Stunned for a few moments as I realize what we had seen, I ran inside the mobile home there, which was the camp kitchen and screamed about what I'd just seen.  The couple of folks that were there were busy and thought I saw something way up in the sky.  So I ran back outside and there were still 2 trails where the two UFOs had p! assed ov er.  I never pursued any action, nor did I call police or any authorities.  What I saw was real, and very close. Twenty years after the fact I want to know what I saw!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

As I live in the city of Los Angeles, I am quite familliar with the presence of helicopters in my day-to-day life. I happened to notice one such helicopter ahead of me as I drove in a south-eastern direction. I paid special attention because I noticed that the \"spot light\" was on. This was of particular concern to me due to the fact that a lit spot light on the freeway could mean that there is a police chase in the nearby vicinity and caution my be exercised. I kept my eye on the craft as I drove and I began to notice that the spot wasn't acutally on at all. In fact, I noticed that the helicopter seemed to be hovering through the air very slowly and smoothly. I then noticed that what I had mistaken for a spotlight was simply one very large white light. Further, I noticed that the craft had NO BLADES. The altitude of the craft was approximately twice that of what a normal helicopter would be navigating at, yet the craft, itself, was large enough to where my perspective of it's altitude was skewed due to it's size. Alarmed, I began driving directly underneath the craft and looked up to see that it APPEARED to be triangular in shape and had a series of ODDLY-COLORED lights flashing on it's underside. I am a skeptic now as I was prior to last night's events. Nonetheless, I'm entirely certain there were/are others who saw what I did. The freeway was fairly busy, although not bumper-to-bumper. If there is anyone out there who could verify that something was hovering over the freeway, it would be greatly appreciated.",

As the object passed I was amazed at how well it held it's course and altitude. It did not appear to be producing any type of trail in the sky, we followed it with our eyes until it was not visible. I would have to say that it was at an altitude of about 1500 ft AGL, traveling between 500 and 700 kts.

It came North real fast and stopped right above the road. we stopped the car almost right under it. It was so close we could of hit it with a rock. It was a shape of unknown and was completely silent. Their was a haze around one side of the object that made the sky look distorted. The radio signal in the car went dead but the car did not stall. We all got out of the car and the same with the other cars on the road that night. This was around 11 pm or so. It hovered there for a few minutes and then  speed off east in an instant . Alot of cars followed us immediatly to the Romeo State Plolice and filed a report that  night of the incident. They said they had similar reports in the area about an half hour after that in that area.

A short distance east of Venus I saw two lights close together about the width of my thumb held at arms length. The light to the right was brighter and faded slowly out. The light on the left faded and brightened a few times then went out. Both lights were stationary. Shortly after they vanished a commercial airliner flew over where they were. The lights were circular and had a pale yellow or golden hue. They were slightly less brilliant than Venus and had a softer definition with some haze around them. I am a fine art conservator with a keen sense of observation. I am also an avid skywatcher and have been interested in UFOs since my first sighting in 1967.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness may have observed landing lights on approaching commercial airliners, but that is a guess.

It sounded as if a helicopter was taking off right in our backyard!  My wife sprang up and looked through the blinds, seeing only a bright white light.  She ran through the house to catch a glimpse out the arcadia window, but within a second or two the object had completely vanished, leaving no sound, no light, no trace.  The time was about 4:30am.  We both had trouble going back to sleep.  Just prior to waking I was having a dream that I was floating or bouncing down a long dark street, accompanied by strangers (possibly police officers) and arriving at a house or a window.  The sound I awoke to reminded me of a military helicopter, but why it would be in or just outside our backyard I cannot understand.  A month or two earlier my wife was driving on a fairly desolate road and saw a very fast-moving \"helicopter\" with a bright white light \"coming toward her.\"  She turned and it vanished quickly.  If you have had any reports of helicopters appearing outside bedroom windows in East Mesa, please let us know.  We are curious to learn what is going on.  Thank you.",

The object itself seemed to ba also made of white light, but the lights at the edges were brighter. The shape was hard to discern, as it seemed very high, about an inch between my fingers, and it glowed with light. The more amazing part to me is that, I had been reading about contact before I left my flat, and I had requested to be able to see 'someone'. I first thought it to be a plane, but the lights did not seem correct. After seeing this thing, I watched it on and off overhead as I walked. Then I entered the building I was going to and felt satisfied that I had seen it, and walked in. I realize this may be explainable, and i would welcome opinions. Mir station? There is a US Army helicopter base in town, so I guess anything is possible. Although this thing gave me the impression that it was very far away. Almost as if it was in space.",

The flying objects flew in various formations first in circles then in a line at a 90degree angle going straight &amp; upwards, then all six objects went into a circular motion.After a while they form another formation by \"falling sideways\" at a  slant of 45 degrees with the the 1st from the top till the fifith objects moving and the sixth (bottom most) remaining stationary. After that they went back to a perpendicular position, evenly spacing themselves out.The scene was more \"entertaining\" than intimidating with all the 38 kids (most of them orphans &amp; some from poor or broken homes. Next, three of them formed a straight line and the remaining three formed a circle, then the three objects that formed a circle converged into one, appearing like a small letter \"i\". Then all the 6 flying objects remained stationery prancing around in all kinds of formation emitting bright orange lights.I took some snapshots using the school's compact camera.As it is now \"festival holidays\" for the Chinese Lunar \"New Year\", I am unable to develop the negatives. There are six teachers and 38 students here and all of us were standing in the school field to witness the phenomena. Icalled the Air Traffic Controller at the local airport/Kuala Lumpur International Airport but none could confirm anything on their \"radar screen\".

What got my attention was that they were flying close enough that if they were Hornet's I would have heard them. Also the stop and go movement, the changing of formation, and the lights. What I mean is, I was stationed at MCAS Beaufort and I have never seen lights on an aircraft that flickered like these. I watched for about 30 minutes as they made there way over towards the the twon of Beaufort. They were so close that I could see the objects rotate and almost flip without breaking their formation. I just went outside and the dogs around the neighborhood are going nuts, but it is really quiet. They are just barking away. I know the air station has a few helicopters(CH-46's) and I know the sound they make. There was no sound but what ever they were stopped and accelerated with no noticeable noise.

It cleared the horizon in less then 4 seconds. The fall took about 3 seconds. As it fell it appeared as if itwere a falling star and was coming straight for us and twinkled white. When it turned it was a globe shpe which appeared as a bright blinking emerald green translucent color. It seemed to fire a strobe burst from the front of the craft which changed colors as it rotated around the craft leaving a trail behind it of white strobes. It looked as if what the trails were was actually the previous position of the craft. Almost like it was occupying both positions at once and was moving quicker then the eye could register.",

There were 4 red lights in a diamond shape. They went on and off about once a second, not flashing but fading smoothly up and down. It travelled south east passing overhead, but not directly over. When it was over our area the size was similar to a large commercial aircraft a few miles from an airport coming in to land. There were no red and green port &amp; starboard lights nor any flashing white lights, only the 4 red ones. The speed was much faster than a commercial jet. Within 30 seconds it had travelled in to the distance and I lost sight of it. There were patches of cloud but otherwise the sky was very clear and the stars were all clearly visible. Perhaps someone else might have seen it so I thought I'd let you have the details. Yours Sincerely, ((name and e-address deleted))",

I got in my car and drove to the beach to investigate (about two minutes away) and got out of my car and walked down on the beach.  The light was orangish and very bright.  I thought it was a planet at first(as bright as Jupiter) but Jupiter was straight up above me, along with another minor planet.  Watching the light, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction very slowly over the ocean, and in the meantime descending gradually.  At that moment I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport here, but it never approached the airport. I then drove north along Pebble Beach Drive to another pullout where I sat awhile, and to my astonishment the object began to move up and down and began to slightly accelerate at certain moments (the object was still very far in the distance) and then it would slow again.  At this instant I just knew it wasn't a plane.  The light then began to appear brighter, and then fade again, where it faded altogether and didn't reappear. I drove down to the end of the road to Point St. George to see if it had appeared again, but the sky was pitch black and there was no light to be seen.  I know there were other vehicles driving along Pebble Beach at the time, and I know someone else must have seen what I had seen--it was too bright to ignore it.",

It was a little over a year ago, in 1999, not 2000. sorry I've never thought of this as a UFO experience but I'm watching a UFO-sightings show on the Travel Channel and one of the things that people in the show had video taped in Florida is the exact thing that I saw from my backyard. I had borrowed a night vision scope from a friend and I was playing with it in my backyard just after the sun had set. I often look at the night-time sky and I live right under the approach path of Ontario airport. Looking north/north-west over my rooftop I saw a sputtering light which looked like something burning fiercely, like magnesium, but not as bright. It was moving too slowly (in my opinion) to be a jetliner, and it wasn't losing any altitude. When I saw it I wasn't looking throught the night-vision scope but the magnitude diminished quickly and I began using the scope which had magnification as well as light-amp. Through the scope I could see the sputtering light very well and before it stopped I saw at least two to three small flare-type objects fall from it.  This is when I realized that the main thing was moving very slowly, like a blimp or something.  The \"flares\" would vanish within a couple of seconds and were not nearly as bright as the main light, and shortly after they dropped from the main part the  whole thing sort of faded away until nothing was visible through the scope or without the scope. I kept looking for something in that direction for 30-45 minutes and saw nothing.and at no time did I see any structure attatched to any of the lights. All of this, in my estimation, was taking place at about 2000 feet in altitude and I think about 20-30 miles away, possibly over the high desert to the northwest of Wrightwood.  I must say however that my ability to estimate values, distances, and altitudes has never been great. I expected to see something in the paper the next day about a airplane/military accident or even on the news shows that night, but nothing ever came of it. So, there it is, I hope this helps.  I would be more than happy to attempt to submit a mor! e detail ed report if you like. I'm only sorry I didn't think more of it when it happened, and I could draw from a fresh memory. Thanks. By the way, I was reading some of the local reports and there is one in Fontana about 10 years ago- a red light 300-500 feet up- stationary, as rain clouds passed by it didnt move...yadda yadda.. Myself and a buddy saw a bunch of people out of their cars in slight rain and looking up, so we stopped and saw that red light.  But quite frankly think it was a light attatched to a kite or something.. but who knows.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

My friends and I were out four wheeling in my friends truck. It was some trails by the Des-Moines river. We were dirving back over this ledge, when plain as day, there was a green light in the sky. At first it looked like a green star. It sat there for about 2 to 3 secounds, then it seemed to fall from the sky, green light was trailing behind it. My friend and I started to freak out. I still can't belive that it happened. It was only two hours ago. Any ways the object was a perfect orb. You could tell that it had three deminsions to it. One of my friends and I are the only ones that saw the whole account. Another member of our party just saw it fall. My other friend that was driving didn't see any of it. We couldn't stop talking about it. My friend that was driving started making fun of us when hiw head lights cut out. We started to go up a hill and couldn't make it up it.I then looked back and I saw a flah of light come out of the woods were the object had apeared to fall.

We were driving westbound Hwy 50 from Mather Air Field. We saw a bright white light, which we thought was an aircraft leaving Sacto. International Airport flying southbound.  This object was not progessing southbound like the many aircraft that we have observed daily. (We live in the flight path of Mather Air Field) The object's light remained bright and round instead of changing as a normal aircraft would as it flys. Once we got home, we got the (10 X 50) binoculars out to observe the object.  The object had moved from the area of the International Airport to (what we can only guess) as the area of West Sacramento. The object was low in the sky and now hovering or stationary.  Two different airplanes, on their normal flight paths from Mather Air Field &amp; Sacto. International Airport were in the sky at the same time.  We compared the object to these aircraft.  Thats when you could really see the difference between the \"object\" and the two aircraft.  Both aircraft had easily identifiable flashing navigational lights, the object had no navigational lights of any type.  The \"object\" could be described as a round white light which slowly pulsated to completely orange, then completely red and then back to white again.

Was working late at the shop and upon heading home(12:30-1 a.m.) I stopped at intersection of hwy 91 leaving town. Intersection is on top of a hill or plateau w/ a small private airstrip directly across the highway. I glanced to my right before pulling onto the highway and noticed a single bright light approaching slowly from the east at approx. 1000 feet AGL. I first thought someone was possibly going to try to land as it was noticeably descending and it looked like a aircraft landing light. (I am a pilot and had a friend who had his airplane hangered there.) Thought it unusual as there are no runway lights. I waited thinking I would shine my headlights down the runway if he circled to land. The light crossed in front of me at about 300-400 feet AGL, I thought, this nut is going to try it. At the same time as it passed directly over the airport hangers, it drops instantly into the valley that drops off the plateau immediately west of the hangers. It went strait down to within a couple feet off the ground FAST and then flew west across the small valley at a speed several hundred mph in a zigzag pattern still hugging the ground. I sat open mouthed. At the other side of the valley was a stand of tall cottonwoods and it flew right up to them and then did another 90 degree strait up without slowing down to a height of probably 1500 feet AGL and went west a short distance and appeared to stop in midair. I sat for a minute astounded by what I had just witnessed, and then turned west on the highway still watching it sit there. (I lived two miles west on the highway) I drove to within 1/8th mile of my house and stopped on the side of highway when it appeared to be strait north of me approx. 3/4 mile. I got out of the car to get a better look at it and to see if I could hear any type of sound from it. It was silent, I thought about shutting off my engine to get complete silence, but decided it might be wiser to leave it running. I stood and watched it for several minutes, it never moved and I had an eerie feeling like it was watching me also. I remember I was lighting a cigarett! e when s uddenly my car QUIT!! Didn't miss or stumble, just quit like I shut off the key. Goose bumps rushed over me as I was a mechanic by trade and that car NEVER, EVER quit before since new. I looked down into the car and there were no dashlights, no digital clock, engine/oil lights...nothing! I reached in and pulled the headlight switch on...nothing. I knew the battery was only 2 mo's old (multimiles best 5 yr. batt.) and I thought this can't be happening to me. I walked to the front of the car and the light was still sitting there motionless. Scared/angry, I yelled at it not to even Think about it! and began walking toward my house 1/8 mile away. I reached home and still it never moved, went in the house, sat in the chair and chain smoked two cigarettes while watching it out the window, never moved so I went to bed. I awoke about 4 a.m., got up, looked out the window and it was gone. Got up next morning, I walked back to my car, thinking, this will tell the story, actually hoping it wouldn't start, proving that it was just coincidence, got in it, stuck the keys in the ignition and turned them...lights, buzzers, everything...tried starting it, it started instantly, I shut it off and it started instantly again. I never could make out any shape of the craft or whatever it was, just a steady bright white light, didn't pulsate or change colors or anything like that. It should be noted that for a year or so before that and after that, there were cattle mutilations being reported in central Nebraska.  Don't know if there is any connection. Later that summer I personaly witnessed one about 4 miles west of my house. A white charlia cow, a \"perfect\" 4-5 inch hole where they removed the sexual organs in the rear, and a perfect 4-5\" hole in its chest in front where they removed the heart. The cow was still sitting in it's sleeping position with it's head curled around as if it was still sleeping. It never awoke or moved, no sign of any struggle, no blood anywhere! Not on it or near it. None! several other people saw it also, along with Greeley co. sheriff. There were no tracks of any kind around it, happened on a saturday nite/sunday morning. My sister also had a light follow her for 10-15 miles home late one night down two different highways. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date of incident is approximate.

Our wifes were screaming and locked the doors, but then everything gets fragmented after that.. We do remember watching it later- way up in the sky, pulsating off and on and zipping back and forth across the sky between the mountains- off in the distance. It zipped out into the middle of the sky waited a few seconds and zipped away, just as a jet zoomed by where it was a few seconds before... We were all very upset, confused, dazed and stopped at the first pay phone. My brother and I had a hard time getting both of us into the booth and getting the door closed to get the light on so we could read the phone book.(too scared to actually complete call)..

My mother told me of the morning he came home from work and he was terribly excited and at the same time freightened about something that had happened on the flightline that night.  He said a large unidentified craft landed directly on the flightline that night.  They had surrounded it for several hours.  There was no contact between the occupants and the base officials.  Finally, just as suddenly as it landed it took off and was gone.  Everyone who had been present for the event and had been told that the incident was to be classified top secret and that they would not speak of it to anyone. It also interesting to note that when my mother told me about this she said that during the time they were stationed at walker no one had ever mentioned the original Roswell incident.  That they heard about it years later on TV.  Seems odd that they would be there 3 or 4 years after the original event and no one ever talked about it even in passing.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date of incident is unknown.

Everyone saw it some even pointed at it.  But no one else was the least bit surprised by it.  It had an inscription on the side as it hovered by... it took me a very long time to read it but it turned out it was english!  As it hovered just a few hundred feet above our heads I could make out \"Good...\" then as my eyes focused \"..Year\".  It said \"GoodYear\" on it.  I peered deeper into the craft and could make out a small figure inside running the entire craft.  How it was able to hover just above our head without wings, I do not know.  It was almost like it could fall at anytime.  I ran into a near by bar to tell everyone there, they were all excited and rushed out.  But the second they laid eyes on it they threw their arms down and went back to drinking.  There was a flashing light on the bottom of it.  I knew that had to be the reason for everyones immeadiate dismissal of the craft.  I don't know why it wasnt working on me, but every single person I went to looked at it, and almost instantaneous laughed or giggled and paid no more attention to it.  Theses ufo's are getting more sophisticated.  It was almost like everyone had seen it a thousand times... could it be that since we are having more and more encounters that the extraterrestials have resorted to mind control?  I'm not sure it was the flashing light, perhaps it was the script on the side of the vessel, perhaps the combination of the words \"Good\" and \"Year\" are some type of code words that allow extraterrestials to bypass our natural instinct of fear!  Again I am not sure as to way these words had no effect to me, but it could all go back to the creations of man, maybe we're some type of hybrid monkey that the extraterrestials used as slaves and as we developed we became more modernized and fearful so they had to implant genes into our gene pool to assure us as potential slaves for future use just in case their newly appointed slaves arent as useful as we once were.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We are quite certain that this report has nothing to do with a UFO sighting.

One day at school during recess our whole school, including my sister and teachers witnessed a flying saucer. This air craft swiftly came from the clouds dropped down to about 40 - 50 feet of the school yard and hovered for about a minute.  We all stood and stared in awe.  It left just as quickly as it came and looked as if it crashed behind a mountain.  One of the teachers called the local sheriff and reported the incident.  He drove the area that this craft could have crashed at and saw nothing unusual. In 1997 my family including my father and sister revisited our old school site.  The school as since burned down.  But my father is a friend of the sheriff that was called that day.  He asked him if he remembered this incident.  He admitted that he didn\u2019t remember that particular incident, but that was because he had been called out on numerous calls involving unidentified flying objects. Besides my sister, we have not spoken with anyone about this incident since it happened.  I guess it was \"swept under the rug.\"  Have you heard of any similar instances in that area?

I looked through the binoculars and could see it was winking red,white and green lights. I was interested because I have seen a star overhead at times like this before, but thought it had changed it's position. As I watched, it turned into a solid red circle, after which it straightened out to a worm shape with some white along the side, also turning into an oblong shape. I must have watched for about twenty minutes while it was changing mostly from a circle to a straight line. A second one came from behind some trees and passed out of sight. I know it was the same but cannot remember now how I knew as I never wrote down any details at the time. It was still there when I left the window but had gone maybe half an hour or so later when I looked again.

When I first noticed it it appeared to be ( best guess ) 2,000 - 3,000 feet altitude ( just hovering silently ) and when it shot back it appeared to leave the earths atmosphere and diguise itself as a star. As I continued to watch it it began to move again in a half circle ( clockwise 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock ) and sped off at a unbelievable speed ( North ) until it had disappeared. Just as it had disappeared another bright light shot in a westerly direction just as fast from the same area. I immediately looked at my watch  and it showed 11:12 pm and I desperately wanted another I witness but as I looked round there was no one else just the silence, no wind just the cold ( approximately -32 C).

I looked to the sky to compare the many other stars on this clear night and this was about ten times the size of star and appeared to have the shape of a diamond. From my driveway the light or object was not blinking nor did it have any color distortion and seemed to be close in vicinity of my home. The moon was low and the object in perspective was seemingly above a rooftop. I wanted to verify if it had any movement so I gauged it next to a tree limb. It moved up and down slightly within seconds when I had it positioned in the tree. I jumped into my car, driving from Kirby and Westpark at 35 mph and chased it going west towards Newcastle &amp; Westpark. It seemed to be unusually dark in this area of the overpass at Westpark &amp; Kirby (near the midsize electricity plant). It was larger than I previously thought and it seemed to move quite fast in front and away from me going west. At one point I thought I would lose it so I sped up eventually driving around 60 mph passing red lights. On Westpark underneath the 59 overpass I noticed a helicopter flying low coming from the south, going north, the light then dimmed, became hazy and barely visible when the helicopter passed. I pulled into a parking lot on Rice Street and Westpark, to observe the object. Once the low flying, low speed helicopter passed that area, the object dimmed and suddenly disappeared, I assumed it traveled at high rate of speed heading west which made it impossible to see.  This occurred less than a half mile from my home. Upon arriving home the object was no longer in the sky near the tree branch where I had first had seen it. Keeping track of time the entire event took less than 10 minutes.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We are suspicious of the planet, Venus, in this instance.

It took a long time to reach crest of mtn. swinging around peak and coming down gulley of mtn. skimming trees. I got gun and went outside. The craft coming down only had light inside like a cockpit. When got close it turned off light. Stopped over back yard and shined a spotlight at my feet. I ran to house next door and looked back and it was gone.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is arbitrarily chosen, since it was hunting season.  Precise date is unknown.  PD",

We were at a point in the canyon that begins to open up (and eventually turns into flat desert about three or four  miles further ahead of where we say the object.) The night was clear.  There was enough natural light from the stars that you could see the cabins and ranches though not much detail.  The other side of the canyon terrain was visible.  It wasn't \"pitch dark.\"  \n\r\nAll of a sudden we noticed movement in the canyon just ahead of us.  We could not make out WHAT we saw because the object was dark.  There was an eery silence.  We both saw it and slowed down to view it. It was in the center of the canyon heading in the direction (into the canyon) that we were leaving.  The massive size of the thing was what struck us as odd, not to mention having no idea as to what we were looking at because it was too big to be going into that area.  \n\r\nWe slowed the Suburban down to watch it.  It was silent, we could see the outline of it due to the way it blocked out everything.  In other words, we could see where it wasn't because the background of the canyon was illuminated enough to outline it.  It was as if this thing absorbed light because there was no reflection from it.  \n\r\nWe both asked one another \"what is that?\"  It had lights at the front and back.  Just small lights.  It moved in a graceful manner with simialr motions to that of a helicopter (up, down, sideways, forward backward).  There was no sound.  \n\r\nI remember thinking it reminded me of the Hindenburg photos I have seen though it did not look \"balloon-like\".  This thing seemed solid.  Just the shape reminded me of it though this was a bit more oval instead of \"cigar-shaped\" as I would refer to the Hindenburg.  \n\r\nWe watched it for a mile or so and then when we looked back again it was gone. There was no way it could have gone into the canyon any further as the canyon narrows.  It was too large.  \n\r\nWe were probably a quarter of a mile from it when we passed it.  Trying to give an idea of its size is difficult.  Maybe the size of a DC-10 jet (if you drew an oval around the jet that is.)  \n\r\nI remember being strangely aware of the eerie feeling though not fearful.  We both just looked at each other and agreed \"that was weird.\"  \n\r\nI have been told by skeptics that \"oh, it was a weather balloon.\"  I disagree though I have no other answer than to explain what I saw.",

It didn't look like an airplane because of the way the lights were.  They were blinking on and off from the right and from the left side.  The lights were coming on in succession from the right side and the left side.  It seemed to have 2 sets of lights, one on the left and one on the right.  There appeared to be about 5 lights on each side.   I think at the same time.  The lights were a white color, nothing unusual.  There were trees in the way and we were trying to find a place to pull over so we could just watch this thing, by the time we went up and over the hill (lost sight of it behind the trees), it was gone.  We pulled over anyway and watched for a few minutes and it was no where to be seen.   There was only one of them.  We were wondering if anyone else saw the same thing. Thank you.

It was around 8:00 PM and the sky was a dark blue, but not yet completely black.  I was lying on the couch watching TV when I heard an eerie sound coming from outside.  The sound was similar to the hydraulic sound made by a garbage truck when it is compacting garbage.  My mother who was in the room with me walked over to the backyard deck to investigate the sound.  Her voice sounded frightened as she yelled, \"Come here quick!  Triangle!  Triangle\";  I was a bit confused, but I got up and looked into the south sky where she was pointing.  There I saw an object in the sky that I have never seen before.  The object was a large, black, equilateral triangle with rounded corners flying horizontal in the sky.  The best analogy of its shape would be to take a sheet of black Styrofoam two inches thick and cut it out like a cookie cutter using a rack from a billiard table.  On each of the three rounded corners, there was a red, glowing light.  Unlike an electric light, this red light had a larger diameter and a uniform glow- like a glowing ball of gas.  On the underside of the vehicle, there was a very large diameter (about 20ft) white light, which appeared to be recessed.  The light was very bright, but did not illuminate what appeared to be the matte black finish of the object itself.  I witnessed no flashing lights of any kind on the object.  .  Based on my proximity to the object, I would estimate that each of the three sides on this object was 90 to 100 ft. long.  The object was flying north and coming straight toward our house.  At no point was the object more than 40 ft. above the tree line.  Approximately 100 ft. before reaching our house, the vehicle made a sharp left turn without banking (staying perfectly horizontal) and proceeded west.  The object then began to descend slightly and disappeared from view over the tree line.  The noise it created faded away second! s later. \t \t     After the object disappeared from sight, we stayed out for about five minutes to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but it did not return.  We called the non-emergency number for our municipality but all we got was a recorded message.  We considered calling the police, but my father insisted that we don't because of all the paperwork that would be involved and for fear of ill gossip and public opinions in our community.  I know that if the situation were reversed, I would probably think that a person who claimed to see such an unusual object were either crazy or they misinterpreted what they saw.   For eighteen years I lived very close to Chicago's Midway Airport and for the last three years I have spent countless hours at the airport as limousine driver.  I have seen every type of flying machine imaginable.  The object I witnessed that night was unlike any object I have ever seen or heard.",

The object was moving back and forth, remaining over my home and backyard tree.  It was as though there was a giant lightbulb in the air.  From my point of view, the light was as big as a large tire.  It was so bright that it lit up every inch of the tree that it was near. The air was just so still and unmoving, there was no wind.  There was no sound, it was an uncanny silence.  Something wasn't right. There was also a vibration that seemed to be shooting down upon my house with such a force that the cement floor beneath me vibrated.  The area was suddenly cast with a red glow and then it was gone.  Everything was back to normal.  What I had thought had only been a few minutes, turned out to be almost a half hour.  That spooked me.  The next day when I awoke, I thought it was just a vivid dream.  I walked outside and was throwing out birdseed for the birds, I noticed little droplets of metallics in the backyard.  Not one or two droplets but 5-6.  Stuff like that would never be in our backyard, and no one knew where they had came from.  But the really strange thing was; was that the droplets must of been melted/hot when they fell in my backyard, because some had dried attached to something.  I heard once from an UFO report that people have seen UFO dripping metal, like the ships were melting. What I really remember is... I wasn't scared.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We will invite the witness to submit samples to NUFORC, and we will report on our attempts at obtaining the evidence.  PD",

We noticed airplanes the whole time we were walking and ironically were talking about UFOs. We were heading back towards the car when I spotted a bright white (almost fuzzy) light flying horizontally quickly just above the tree line about a 1/2 mile away from us.  I watched it for a few seconds without saying anything to my friend, but then I realized I couldn't make out that it was a plane, plus it was flying so low I told him to take a look.  Just about then, the white started to sort of fuse into red and as it turned completely red, it suddenly split into two separate red lights.  The \"newer\" light sort of did a sharp u-turn up and backwards as the other remained steady on it's course horizontally.  Then the one further behind headed back in the direction of the other only further back and higher up.  We watched until they were out of sight. We assumed because it was July 3rd, that probably Hanscom Airforce Base in Bedford was putting on an air show.

At first sight, I thought maybe it was an airplane but upon further examination it clearly wasn't an airplane.  I think my first words where \"what kind of airplane is that?\" or \"what the heck is that?\" as I pointed the object out to my cousin. The object appeared burnt-orange or amber in color.  There were no distinguisable lights or strobes on this object as you would see on an airplane or helicopter.  The whole object appeared to be dimly illuminated and slightly shimmering or hazy.  Although the object seemed fairly close, the manner in which this object was illumination made it very difficult to determine exactly what shape it was.  I would have to identify it as triangular shaped and it appeared to have a flat bottom surface. When we first saw the object it was just slightly in front of us and traveling away from us in an east, northeast direction.  At one point, as the object was moving away, i thought the back of the object seemed to have the shape of a boomerang with the ends pointing down.  The object was traveling in a very smooth, fluid-like motion and was completely silent.  It was also traveling deceptively fast too.  Upon first sight the object was roughly the size of the finger nail on my pinky finger held at arms length but in about 5 seconds it had traveled far enough to appear as a mere point of light.  As we were both watching this thing in disbelief and trying to figure out what it was it instantly shifted directions and was heading north for about 1 second the shifted directions again and was heading east for about 1 more second until it vanished from sight.  I have never seen any plane or helicopter on television or in real life that could change directions so rapidly.  We were both completely awestruck by what we witnessed that night and I have been thinking about it o! n a dail y basis ever since.",

It was a clear night and many people who were outdoors praying on this 8th day of the Chinese New Year were puzzled as to what these objects were. With my \"not so powerful\" binoculars my family members and I could make out that it was disk shaped, had a very bright orange flame burning at the center and it rocked slowly at approximately 45 degrees angle. In all there were more than 15 of these objects and the display lasted more than one hour. Some were just little dots but a few flew quite low but there was no noise to indicate that it was an aircraft. A similar sighting was on the 24th of January 2001 at approximately 10pm.",

I must have been starring up into the sky do south looking for anything such as meteorites, constellations, I had been scanning the southern sky for about 20 minutes when I suddenly realised that there was a patch of the sky that was starless. At first I didnt recognise anything beyond that until I watched that area a few more seconds when this very large triangular ship materialized right in front of me. Its hard to explain but it was like-cloaked in such a way that at first you could stare right at it you wouldnt see it but when I focused on it I could easily see it. This craft was very close. Estimate size 200ft. I would estimate 60 yards away. Light eminated from it as if it had a low glow to it. No specific lights only the craft itself was lightly ablase. This led me to believe that its stealth quality was do to its ambient light equal to the light from the stars and street lights. Anyway I could make out the ships color which was a light brown or tan similar to the camoflage color used in the Military for desert combat. It was in a position gaining altitude at least a 45 degree angle and yaued left pitch where I had a good view of its top surface but not its bottom. It was perfectly silent as it moved gracefully and slowly at first. Estimate 20 mph. Then the higher it got and further  from my position it picked up incredible speed. It winked out of vision withen a few seconds heading in a due southerly direction. I was able to make out some details in the ships design such as rounded edges and the triangular shape was very slightly ovate in that it had a slight concave curve to its over-all body. It appeared very high tech and what I would expect to see in our own technology withen a few hundred years.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I could see the lights on it which it had a red triangle underneath in the middle and a white light in front - it was a complete triangle not a stealth bomber which has like a triangle but v-shape to it.

We were travelling about 30 mph when I noticed a glowing light up by the ONLY street light on that road. Just as I noticed the light it moved VERY QUICKLY towards the windshield (I thought it was going to hit us) then travelled with us for about 2 seconds when the driver suddenly hit the brakes and swerved out of the way at which time it QUICKLY flew off to our left through a clearing and over the ridge out of sight. The driver and I got out of the car and his date remained in the car crying and very scared. When we returned to the car we gathered our senses and I demanded that we each write down what we saw (as to avoid convincing each other of our encounter). When we compared what we saw, we all came to the same conclusion that we had seen a UFO. It was a translucent image about the size of an SUV. It had, what appeared to be a fan propeller, but it moved rather quickly for it ot be powered by a propeller. We could tell it had a very bright light because when it took off to our left it lit up the trees around it before darting down the ridge about 60-100 yards away.",

We came around a line of high hedges that lined the street across from my house. On the other side of the hedges was a open field area.  Not a huge area but large enough to play ball. Thats what we were going to do. As we came around the corner of the hedge we all saw a silver disk approx 60 feet across just hoovering about 10 feet off the ground.  It was very close to a house on the other side of the clearing.  There was no sounds, no lights, it was bright day light and the sun was out. It just hoovered and would spin very slowly. We all looked at each other and said Wow! Then suddenly it thrust straight upward so fast it was like it vanished. A few seconds later, as we all were looking up into the sky, one of my friends pointed and yelled, There! There it is! As I again saw the craft. It was flying horizonal across the sky at about 2000 feet and there was a aircraft near it at one point. I remember the sun light shinning off the plane but not the disk.  I can see it today as if it just happened.  Because of obvious reasons I never told anyone about this until recent years. In fact as I was visiting my older brother in North Carolina. I brought this up and took a deep breath as I awaited my brother to begin to laugh. But he said\" Ya I saw it too! Not that day but another night with some of his friends. He is 4 years older than me. Same kinda craft but it was flying very close to the water tower up on the top of the hill. There was a school there also. I think it was Hoban.

We saw objects very high in the sky near the constellation Orion.  We went out to look every so often between 9:00pm and 10:30pm.  They were there the whole time.  The UFOs were brighter and seemed to be closer than the stars in Orion. At first they seemed to be stars but when we took time to look at them we could see there were two lights very close together.  Every 10-30 seconds (approx. it varried) a sparkling light would shoot out from each \"craft\". They remained mostly stationary but we occaisionaly saw one move  a short distance, suddenly. The second night, we saw them again in about the same places.  We invited our 19 year old son out to see them. One seemed larger, brighter, (we assumed it was closer) but the second night everything was about the same as the first night.  Tonight, 2/1/01, the third night, there were clouds early in the evening but some of them (5-6) were still visible, even though Orion was not visible.  The one that seem closer than the others was now even closer.  Later in the evening, 10:00pm the sky cleared.  At that time the one that had been close was gone and only 4 remained. My husband and I are educated and our son is in college, we are a stable, Christian, family.  My husband works for a department store and I work in a college library.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they seemed quite sincere.  We believe they may have been looking at bright planets, or \"twinkling\" stars, but we are not certain.  That would not explain the number of objects they allegedly witnessed, and it would not explain the objects that allegedly were reportedly ejected from the lights.  PD",

It was about 9:00pm and very cold out (on the verge of freezing). I happened to look up and to my surprize a flare-like object shot throught the sky as if it had been fired out of a gun. It was faster than anything I have ever seen before.  My initial thought was that of a bottle Rocket, but no bottle rocket travels at the speed that this thing was moving.  The most interesting part of this is that the object fired off from a central point in the sky. Its as if the object was floating and then just suddenly blasted off. The object immediately formed a vapor trail.  This was the strangest vapor trail I have ever seen in that it had a vibrant white glow and it sort of looked like a dark blueish outline formed around the edges of the trail.  I am possitive that it wasnt a space shuttle landing, because I have seen the trail that forms from a space shuttle and this was far bigger and brighter.  Once again, nothing has ever passed my eyes at the speed that this thing was traveling.  I also noticed that although it seemed like it was only 200 or so feet above me at the start, as I drove into a clearing over Lake Travis (right by Mansfeild Dam) the trail looked like it was 5 miles high.  I have explained my sighting to the best of my memory.  I must say that this has opened my eyes a little to the possibility of extraterrestrial airships.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

However, one evening [late summer or fall??] I saw lights over the trees that were somehow different, and then I realized something very large was blocking the night sky.  I kept listening for the sound of engines or jets, but there was total silence. The craft was huge, so large that it may have been higher than I first thought.  At the time, as it passed over [an angle of about 30 degrees to the left of right over my head] it seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred yards above treetop level. The eeriest part was the dead slow speed and total absense of any sound.  The second thing I realized was that it had \"headlights\" under where one would expect the cockpit to be [4 or 6?], but none of the FAA required 'navigation' lights on wingtips, and no strobe light. The color was generally a dull black, a bit lighter than the night sky so some shape details could be picked out and not just  the silloette.  It was a wide triangular shape, wider than our stealth bombers but not as wide as the old \"flying wings\" of the mid-40's.  It was relatively thick, with a 'cut away' portion in front where what appeared to be cockpit windows were above the 'headlights' previously mentioned. Nothing of note was seen on the bottom, no lights, no indentations, nothing but smooth dull black. Living close to Wright Patterson AFB I might expect to see experimental craft in the area, but not ultra-slow totally silent craft lacking the FAA required lighting.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

A close plane with its landing lights coming into our local airport would be about the right brightness, but when it moved away it was obvious that it was several thousand feet if not several miles away.

Attendance of 9000 people. There are two incidents of interest witnessed by meself and some others. On friday the 14th of July 2000, at aproximately 23:00 I was standing aproximately 500 meters away from the main airplane hangar that contained a major portion of the production. The evening was overcastbut earlier there was some light rain and some summer lightning,but no stars were visible and cloud cover was at 100-150 meters above ground level. At this time I witness a red flash of lightning come out of the clouds and strike the main hanger containing the majority of people but what struck me as odd was there was no sonic resonance to the lightning, for those who don't know what that is there was no thunder present even though I was standing only 500 meters away. I shook my head not believing what i had seen and went about the evening as if nothing had happened. Later in the morning i was talking with my friend and I happened to remember the flash and I thought I would tell him what I saw. To my astonishment after relaying the story he told me he was relieving himself on the other side of the hanger at aproximatelly 100 meters away at the same time as my observation when he said he saw red lightning hit the main hanger. I did not know what to think at the time. Later that weekend on the early morning of the 16th of july 2000 at aproximately 03:00. The sky was clear and stars were visible. I was standing outside the back of the main hanger in the sound workers camping area talking with the urinator and another friend when all of a sudden another man i had met earlier in the weekend comes running up to us and says \"Can you help me with a problem?\". To my observation it looked like he had seen a ghost or something. So I said \"What's the matter?\". He replies \"Why the F**K are the stars moving?\", at this point he pointed to one of th! e bright est stars direcly over head. I asked him what kind of drugs he was on and he replied in a tone that can only be described as the most truthful in the world that I have ever experienced, that he was totally sober. Then he said look and pointed again at the star. So my friends and I look up. To my complete shock and bewilderment an object which looked like a star at first on closer observation was moving around rapidly within a small vector of space, not alot but enought that you could see tracers where the object was moving from and going to, like a fly around an invisible light. It looked unbeleiveable. I immediatly expressed my disbelief at what I saw. My pale faced friend then pointed out a second bright star not to far from the first light and this light was a bit different than the fist. This one had blue and red lights on the bottom of the bright light and they were pulsing on and off slowly. My friend then pointed out the third and final anomlous light and this one seemed to have a spot light that was scaning the horizontal airspace around it as it was in the air. As well there seemed to be a haze around and behind the lights kind of like a really really faint aroura borealis around each one. I dont know how long they were there for before 03:00 but i observed them for 1 half of an hour, before i went and did something else. Later in the morning just before the sun was coming up I looked for the anomilous stars or lights and they had moved on or i could not see them because it was getting brighter.",

I was 20 years old at the time, home for summer after my sophomore year at UNC-CH. Considering the time period, it is important to note that I did not use drugs and drank very rarely.   We lived in the semi-country, about 1.5 miles from the Greensboro Airport.   I had just walked into the edge of the woods  to burn our trash in the burn-barrel.  As I came out of the woods, I saw a disk with a diameter of about 20 feet silently rotating just off my right side.  It was 30 to 40 feet off the ground and had alternating flat red and white lighted panels around its sides.  I stood there literally frozen for at least a minute watching the red and white lights as they slowly and silently rotated.  My German Shepherd sat down transfixed.  When I had the wherewithal to return to the house, I had to call him several times to come with me.  I went inside to call my father (no one was at home at the time), and my dog remained on the back porch steps, still transfixed.  Several minutes later when I went back outside, the disk had disappeared.  My dog, an excellent watchdog, never barked once. I can still vividly recall that night.

I made the cans and then we checked constantly to insure proper sealing. \n\r\nWhen the salmon season was over I decided to go to Anchorage and secure a job.  This was not to be and I found myself working for the Civilian Conservation Corp.  I helped establish the Camp at Eklutna, 27 miles north of Anchorage, on the now old highway.  This was the construction site of Eklutna's Power Plant buildings and all were still intact and we took it over. \n\r\nThe exact number of young men who arrived there was probably ten and they were all, I believe, from the Eastern States--New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts.  \n\r\nIt was cold, 20 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit, with about ten inches of snow on the ground.  We all slept in the large bunkhouse and free time was spent around the coal burning stove playing cards, reading or just conversation.  \n\r\nOne of the fellows was called Peterson.  \n\r\nWeekends were long and the biggest activity was chuckingcoal in the stove.  Everyone took turns to keep the fire going during the night. \n\r\nOn this particular Saturday night Peterson and I decided to try to hitch a ride to Anchorage and go to a movie.  The others thought we were out of our minds with the freezing cold and all.  The two of us started out, the sky was pitch black with the stars glistening like jewels and the air was still.  \n\r\nWalking along at a brisk pace, to keep warm, we much have covered four or five miles and no cars came.  \n\r\nAs we entered an open area we heard this sound, turned around and saw this intense bluish light.  Oh, joy!...a truck it had to be with one headlight burned out.  Wrong!  It was not on the road but up in the AIR!  \n\r\nThis was startling to say the least.  The sound we heard was like the sound of a jet turbine being shut down--not a high pitched sound.  \n\r\nDumbfounded--it took a few seconds for us to react.  It seemed it was moving rather slowly--maybe 35-40 miles per hour.  In the ensuing moments we flattened ourselves in the snow when it passed overhead.  \n\r\nIn the few moments I looked at it, it was to all appearances cigar-shaped with the bluish light on the side.  However, a few seconds later, when light faded some, I looked up and it appeared wider. \n\r\nPeterson and I were now standing up looking at the object heading east.  It was headed toward a mountain or high foothills.  As we kept looking at it, we both thought it would crash into the mountain.  It seemed to lift up and went over and down the other side.  \n\r\nWe looked at each other and exclaimed, \"What the hell was that?\" We decided to return to the Camp, which we did, wondering what it was we had seen. \n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Report submitted in written form to the National UFO Reporting Center by Mr. Holger Berg (1917-2001).  Our gratitude to Mrs. Berg for typing the report.  We spoke with Mr. Berg on many occasions about his sighting, and we found his story to be most compelling.

I wondered what they were looking at, so I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a red-orange light in the sky. I turned around and pulled over behind another car and asked them what they were looking at. They handed me a pair of binoculars and pointed to the same red-orange light. When I looked through the binoculars, there weree three red-orange light arranged in a triangle shape with the point downward. This object was directly to the north between the tops of some trees and moving to the east toward the Springerville Generating Station, but far enough away that it could not have been caused by the plant. We stood there watching the light for well over 30 minutes and it remained for more than an hour; I know this because we kept looking for it. Finally, around 8:30 or so, the object went behind a large cloud and I lost track of it. That does not mean it dissapeared, it just means I had to leave. Based on the haze of the sky and power plant emmissions that I saw when looking through the binoculars and the lack of a coherent outline, I believe the object was a long way away.",

I'm doing this because someone official must know. In the later part of 1989, at approximately 9 p.m., while driving home from dinner at my mother's house, I noticed bright lights moving very slowly toward my right, above the tree line.  I've always been intrigued by U.F.O's and feel I'm quite knowledgeable on the subject.  I had always thought that if I had ever saw one,I would not be afraid, but rather I would want to approach it.  Was I ever wrong.  I stopped to observe a round shaped disk coming my way above the trees to my right while still in my truck.  Slowly it approached.   Surrounded by very, very bright lights, not blinking lights but solidly lit.  At this time, the object is right by me so I get out of my truck, leave the door open, walk around the door to the driver's side fender and look at the craft.  When I realized there was no noise coming from it, that's when I knew what it was.  The biggest rush of fear went through me like I never  knew.  The craft was only about 50 yards from me.  I jumped in my truck, drove forward 200 yards, made a left, stopped and watched it slowly move away for about five minutes until I couldn't see it anymore.  My house was just around the corner.  I went in and woke up my roomate, ((name deleted)).  He went to bed way early because he had to go to work at 4:00 a.m.  I told him what I had seen.  He said I was crazy.  We went out front in the yard and I started telling him the story.  Just a few minutes into my story, as I was pointing in the direction of the sighting, we heard a noise from behind.  We turn and look.  About 3 or 4 black helicopters buzz the house and fly in the direction I'm pointing.  Steve didn't think I was so crazy then. I'm reporting this because lately it's been weighing on my mind.  50 yards is close!  If someone would contact me, I would like to tell them things about the craft and the amazingly effortless way that it moved. Please take this sighting seriously.  I am a business owner in Austin and have a reputation as an honest person.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I went with the family next door to a lake just north of Toronto for a day of swimming.  The family consisted of a Mother, Father and two daughters.  I remember the car was a \"Duster\". The incident happened on the way home.  There was some discussion between the parents whether or not to look for the object they had seen.  (I think one wanted to and the other did not.  Us kids really weren't paying attention yet.) We found the \"ship\" on the front yard to a farmhouse.  It had, I believe, 4 legs that were quite long (2 or 3 metres) with a sphere on top.  It was grey/metallic in colour.  The door/hatch was in the shape of (what looked like to me) a lions head. I saw the hatch start to open and the family start to get out.  The next thing I knew we were driving down the highway, singing to the radio as if nothing had happened. I always used to think of this a \"my encounter\".  But since learning more about the phenomena of ufos (through programs such as Jeff Rense and reading Missing Time by Budd Hopkins) I now suspect that a member of the family I was with was/is an abductee and that I was simply \"switched off\".  I don't know how much time is missing -- I was just a kid -- but it seemed to me at least an hour or two darker after the encounter than just before.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I had never seen anything interesting in the night sky until the night of July 25, 2000. After this event I immediately typed up what I saw and sent a fax right off to Mike Seigal at Coast to Coast AM. As far as I know he never covered it ...and I don't know of anyone but the 3 of us who were present who saw this event. However, I thought you might like to add it to your records and perhaps someone else has sent an account of it to you as well. Here is the text that I typed: Attn: Mike It is now 10:25 pm (July 25, 2000) Pacific. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and just less than an hour ago I was on the very south end of the valley looking north towards the Stratosphere Tower (a distance of 10-15 miles if I had to guess) ...showing a guest of mine from the East Coast a nice view of the Strip from a high elevation. There were three of us present and we noticed extremely bright glowing lights at approximately the level of the Tower, but well beyond it. You could see the lights of aircraft crossing the Las Vegas Valley, but these lights were 20-30 times brighter and stationary with a slight drift to the right (East). One of these lights dropped suddenly to the valley floor and disappeared. After several minutes the others flickered and faded as well. As soon as they were gone another set appeared at a much higher elevation ...in relation to the tower, almost twice as high. These kept fading after about five minutes and reappearing in sets of two and three ...only a single time was there only one light in the sky. I called a local television station, KLAS channel 8 and asked them if anyone else had reported this ...they said no, but said they'd train their stationary cameras on it (in retrospect, I don't think they took what I was saying seriously). All the while the Vegas.com blimp, a tourist airship here in Las Vegas was in the sky and provided a good point of reference. They took off from the North Las Vegas airport, about 25 miles from where I was in the valley, but they were much smaller (the airship is lit from the interior and the size of the Goodyear Blimp) in relation to the size and brightness of the lights. The best analogy I can draw is to the Phoenix Lights incident of '97 that I've seen time and again on TV. Unfortunately I didn't have a camera, but this incident was far and away more interesting than the Phoenix one. I understand that some explanations there include military flares, and this could have been what I witnessed. However, some of the lights dropped all the way to the! Valley floor and I wouldn't have expected that to happen if military excercises were being conducted on the Nellis Range over the other side of the mountain range in the north part of the Valley. However, as I mentioned, these lights did not all descend in elevation ...what one would expect if they were flares attached to parachutes. I hope that someone captured this on video ...there must have been many eyewitnesses, including those in the blimp, in the airport tower, and elsewhere. I'm also curious if this will be discussed on the 11 o'clock news, but as I finish typing this it is now only 10:35 and being a listener from time to time of your show I thought that you might enjoy this bit of information.

(The 70's}   We lived by a cornfield and the corn was still green, so it must have been some time during the summer.  This happened in Yorktown Indian, right beside walnut street, a few miles out side Muncie, about 40 miles from Indianapolis.  I remember that my parents would invite my grand parents over to watch the strange lights and vehicles in the sky.  I remember seeing a few cigar shaped objects in the sky my self, but this isn't the main part of my sighting.  As a kid the neighborhood children and myself would play in the cornfields.  Most of us knew about the lights, but being young we really didn't think much of it.  What we did find that that struck us as odd was a circle burned into the corn, far out in the field.  It was as I remember a perfect circle of charred corn stalks about six inches wide, and the circle was about fifteen to twenty feet across.  The corn was pressed flat, as was the unburned corn inside the circle.  We knew the field pretty well and there was no farm machinery that went through the field during those summer months.  Out side the circle were sets of footprints that led out of the circle, but not very far from it then back to the circle.  What we found so unusual about them to us was that they were maybe 4 to six inches deep, with no tread marks, the bottom of the prints were flat with no tread that would be on a normal shoe or farmers boot.  On the surface of the footprint in the dirt was something that looked like green moss.  There were no tire marks leading to or away from the circle.  The soil wasn't soft, we didn't leave prints this deep, while we ran and played in the field, and that's what we found odd also.  I brought my mother out to the site so she also witnessed it.  She didn't know what to make of it ether.  My older brother was one of us kids that saw it also.  There are no military bases in the area, or even a airport of any size, so I don't think it was some \"government project\".  As far as I know the field is still there, and Yorktown is a very small town sleepy farm town, so I don't think anything has been built over the area.  If needed I can locate the other people that I knew at the time to verify the story, (the other children, by brother, and mother.  \n\r\nThanks for Listening,\n\r\n((name deleted))",

I was staying up late with a younger child.  I believe it was a summer night about 1:30 or so in the morning.  I don't think we were supposed to be up but when you are that age and you have a friend over you sometimes want to stay up all night and play.  My bedroom window faced north just outside a highway and I was looking outside at the sky and hills when I noticed an airplane.  I would guess now that it was 5 miles out?  The airplane was rather odd however.  Instead of the alternating red/green wing strobes it had 2 red strobing lights evenly spaced that flashed slowly and simultaneously.  I became very interested because I had never seen an airplane at night that had lights like that.  I watched for a while and it seemed like the aircraft was floating in the air.  It was moving (north-south), but every airplane I had seen fly before would have passed over by then (I had been watching for maybe 5 mins.)  I wanted to know what kind of airplane it was!  I opened the window hoping to hear any engine noise.  Was it a jet or rotory craft?  as it came closer over the window, I turned off the light partly out of fear partly to cut the glare from the room light.  Fear.  I still couldn't make out the shape, just the lights.  I began to stop thinking it was an airplane.  I was very afraid but excited and curious at the same time.  The object was just overhead.  I cannot remember the silhouette.  But it must have been 200ft overhead just gliding over slowly lights blinking.  Absolutely no noise!  I could have ridden my bicycle faster than it was traveling.  My friend saw it too, but I don't remember his reaction.  As soon as it left my field if view (directly over the roof), I ran to my parent's bedroom.  I wanted an adult to see it!  They told me to go to bed.  I rushed out the front door I was no loger afraid, I wanted to see it closer.  At the rate of speed it was going it should have still been over the roof.  When I went outside the night was still and quiet and the object was gone. I have seen all kinds of airplaned since.  Blimps, ultralights have motors...  Other airplanes have engines that make much more noise.  I have seen a jet at night with only a single red strobe, but never two that flash slowly and simultaneously.  Now that I know more about aircraft, I realize that at that altitude and speed it should have stalled.  It couldn't have been going more than 15mph. I wish I had more visual details to report.  Many years have gone by and it was night.  The memory still strikes me.  I hope taht someday I will find a decent explaination but I am afraid I will never find one.  The impression after the incident was that it wasn't man made.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

It was a clear night, no cloud cover. My middle brother and I were sittimg on the left hand side of the airplane just behind the wing area. I first noticed what appeared to be a rocket with a short fire trail coming from the left and from behind us. I immediately got my brother's attention and as the rocket got closer to us it became larger and the fire trail behind it grew longer. After watching this happen for about a minute the rocket was approaching towards us faster and faster. After watching this for 20 seconds we both got our father's attention who was sitting a few isles in front of us on the other side of the plane. He got out of his seat and came over and we showed him the rocket. He then called my mom, my youngest brother, and a family friend of ours to come over to our side of the plane and look out the window in order to see this object too. By the time they all got out of their seats and saw the object, approximately 45 seconds of time had elapsed since the beginning when I first saw it. By this time the rocket appeared much larger and was located just a hundred feet from the end of the wing. Instantaneously, the rocket fizzled out and changed shape into a \"typical flying saucer.\" The saucer remained just off the end of the wing tip and then several white lights appeared in the middle of the craft; they looked similar to small windows. The craft then expelled a bunch of white sparkling lights and fire trails (simliar to sparklers) and then emitted all kinds of different colored lights that flew in all directions. Then the craft  literally disinegrated before our eyes and vanished, but I should note that it streaked away from the airplane while it vanished. The whole sequence of events lasted over a minute. Furthermore, we immediately questioned the flight attendants about it and one or two of them said! they sa w the craft too. Shortly thereafter they inquired the pilots about the event. They told us that the pilots responded to them by saying that they had personally not seen the craft or the event, but that they were contact by 2 or 3 other commercial aircraft flying nearby who reported they saw an unidentified aircraft flying close to our airplane. They wanted to know what was going on. Our pilots said they never saw the object(s).\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I decided to look up at the sky and block the sun out of my view to see if the theory of being able to see things in the sky was true, as i had just seen a story on doing that on a T.V show called \"Sightings\".  To my absoute surprise i did.  It was a very bright shining and pulsating object that appeared to shimmer.  I was much more silver than the sun itself, which seemed to be yellow in comparison.  This was a strange thing to see since i had a very memorable dream about meeting with aliens only a few days earlier.  In the dream they took me around the USA and showed me where they had bases, the strange thing was though, they all looked the same, and to me in my dream they looked like businessmen in suits.  I was wondering if i could communicate with the people flying it, this just came to me, so i asked them in my mind to fly in such a way that i could prove to myself that they were not an earthly aircraft.  In about 10 seconds it begen to fly in tight circles at an incredible speed, this clearly could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon or satilite.  When it finished, i heard in my head... \"there you go\". I was impressed beyond belief! I was in the presence of other people at the tiime and could not understand why they didn't look up to see what it was i was looking at so intently, it seemed that they didn't even notice me.  I felt the need to tell someone so i could get a second witness, however when i had that thought...I heard, or felt a thought that i should not do this and that this experience was a GIFT TO ME, so i din't tell anyone there at the time.  As i indicated this went on for 20 minutes.  The vehicle flew all over the sky at incredible rates of speed, covering an entire two thirds of the horizon in a few seconds, it was uplifting and joyful to watch, i had such a feeling of overwhelming wellbeing within me. At the end, after the spinning circles, they indicated that they needed to leave as they were being tracked, even though i never saw! any pla nes up there, and it took off to the west, out over the Pacific so fast that i don't know if it disappeared or left my view.  I have seen many lights in the sky and have had numerous strange experiences throughout my childhood in Australia, along with psychic events all my life, but this was the clearest i have ever seen in daylight.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Anonymous report.

On Saturday, October 16, 1999, I was scheduled to work late, and I did not get home until around 9:30-9:40 p.m.  As I got out of my car, I looked in the sky over my house (to the north west).  I saw something (I guess I thought it was a plane at first)that looked a little odd.  I walked out the my back yard to get a better view.  I saw 3 craft.  They  were triangular in shape and were traveling fairly close together.  They had very little lighting, but the shapes were quite clear.  They seemed to be flying fairly low, but I couldn't begin to estimate their distance.  I watched for 2-3 minutes in awe.  They seemed to have some movement, but they didn't seem to really travel across the sky.  After a couple of minutes, I ran inside to get my husband so he could see, but when I finally got him out there, the crafts were gone.  I happened to mention this to my parents on the following day, even though I knew they would think I was probably crazy.  Instead, they told me that their best friend (now deceased) had witnessed the exact same thing two months prior to my sighting.  He lives about 70 miles north of me, so it not quite in the same vicinity.  Both sightings included the three craft that were dull, black with white lights on each corner of the triangle.  This is fairly vague information, but until I listened to Art Bell tonight, I hadn't really considered reporting what I had seen.  I have forgotten most of the specifics, but I did want this to be on some type of record.  I had never really doubted the idea of UFOs, but I never thought I would actually see something which couldn't easlily be explained.",

But I was not able to get the all the information they needed. I will give you the just of it, I was 12 years of age and I had a older cousin in the Canadian military and at the time (1982) he was stationed at the Cold lake military complex in Cold lake, Alberta, Canada. I was 11 years old we (me and my family) drove from Edmonton to Cold lake to visit my cousin (he has been there for a good amount of time like 2-3 years) we went to the base and he then gave us a tour and some time into the tour he took me (only me) we went throw some hangers and hall ways and then into a space between 2 hangers and he lifted me up to have a look into a window into a hanger and what I saw was an image that will never fade away form my mind ever! What I saw was 3 objects one was a disk silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus round the 2nd was a cigar shape and silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus the 3rd I did not see very well. The thing that Chris and Stanton ask me was to get my cousin to come forward with this information. I did talk with him on this subject and he says \"he does not remember.\"  And that's were it ended. As for my second encounter I was traveling north from Calgary to Edmonton in the summer of 1998 the time was 10:42pm or 10:45pm. And in the sky I saw what I thought was a very bright falling star, well I never seen a star do this   It was traveling (slow) southeast leaving a long white trial and if I was holding a ruler in my hand at arms length it measures 7\" to 7.5\"; long the trail remand in the sky for 20 to 25 seconds  It stopped for about 15 to 20 seconds and then shot (very very fast) off in a 90\u00ba angle north east leaving a bright red trail the red trail did not stay long only for 3 to 5 seconds.

At first I thought I was dreaming but then heard it again and realized that an eerie green light was coming in the window and was flooding the orchard to the east of the house. I woke my husband who saw it too and we immediately rushed to make sure the baby was OK. We weren't able to see anything but the light. Either it was foggy out or the light itself had a foggy quality. We were aware if it for about 2 to 3 minutes and then it moved away to the southeast and was gone. The following morning some of the local radio stations carried reports of UFO sightings to the south and east of us. We did not see a craft - only the light coming from not too high over the orchard.

It was during the daytime when he saw a bright bluish-green light in the sky.  It was so bright that it seemed to light up the whole area even in daylight.  It seemed to be hovering in the sky and my father assumed that it must have been a comet that was flying directly towards him so that it created the illusion of hovering.  It disappeared after a while, and he never told anyone about it because it was so strange.  Also, he noted that there seemed to be some sort of cylindrical/prism-like shape inside the light and sketched it out for me. I happened to be flipping though a book on UFOs and noticed a blurb about Project Twinkle and realized that the dates and descriptions matched exactly.  So, I guess that this means that the perceived phenomena was not restricted solely to the American Southwest. Also, my father is highly rational and pragmatic and doesn't indulge in thoughts about the paranormal.  Neither of us previously knew anything about Project Twinkle.  The perfect match between his description and dates with the Project Twinkle sightings confirms that what he saw was real.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date in 1948-1950 is approximate.

There were 2 objects in the sky at the time between 45 and 65 degrees off the horizon. One closer (the parachute) and the other was further away (what I thought was the plane). I thought that this guy was crazy because this was in the middle of Dallas and it was very high up. This was going to be on the evening news for sure. I ran inside and got my friend who came out and I showed him and what appeared to be a parachute. When I returned it changed into a circular silver/white object that didn't represent the first object that I had seen, but still remained in the same location. I was gone about 15 seconds. The two objects matched each other now in color, size and movement. I asked my friend what do you think it is.. He said \"a plane of course.\" We turned around and I showed him a plane in the sky that was moving at a high altitude 180 degrees from the location of the objects. No comparison. The two objects were moving very slowly together in a northerly direction. Their movements were very calm and not jittery. I asked my friend if he had some binoculars or a zoom camera. He brought out a Nikon 35mm with a non-zoom lens. I was able to capture pictures of the objects, but not as close as I wish. I captured several pictures of the two objects and as they continued to move slowly across the sky an identical 3rd object appeared. Within 4 minutes all 3 objects were no longer visible. The sighting lasted a total of 10 minutes. I was able to capture about 5 pictures. Pictures will be sent in this evening (I hope!).",

One night while viewing stars with his four inch scope he came accross a ball shaped object hovering in space. The ball was large enough in his small lense so that he could actually see some sort of hyroglific writting on the object. He desperately wanted to go in and get his larger ten inch scope but did not leave for fear of losing sight of the object completely. After watch the object for ten minutes all of a sudden four smaller craft came out of the larger object in a single file at a slow speed and departed. Bill kept his focus on the large object.

The house I lived in was on a hill with its front porch facing South. The house, called Langdon House, was leased by my employers for we, the hotel and kitchen staff. That evening there were only three of us home out of 13 other housemates. I, on the first floor, and two women on the second floor. At 8:45pm (eastern) I left my room, and to this day I don't know why I felt compelled to do so, grabbed a pair of binoculars and went out and sat on the front porch, facing south. It was mid to late June and still pretty light out. I remember this like I remember my own name. Due south was a light, midway from the horizon line, that seemed to be pulsating and changing colors. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but when I peered through the binoculars the light looked too close, and its colors too distinct. Red, blue, green and white. I watched it for some time with binoculars. In fact I thought \"oh my god, this can't be what I think it is,\" when I heard a buzzing or a humming. I, still seated on the front porch, turned to my right and saw an object moving very slowly and seeming to hover at about 100 feet. It was vaguely triangular because it looked hazy, like orange translucence. But it gets even stranger. In the moment that it took to turn my head to the right, the evening light blackened and I could see no stars. Just the light in front of me facing south pulsing, changing colors and the object moving round my to my right. Right then and there I decided that I was not going to be the only nut witnessing this and ran into the house and up the stairs, where I found two female coworkers and housemates. I blabbered something about lights, my words travelling 80 mph. They followed me outside. When the three of us got back outside, we walked around the right side of the house where there is a driveway and a small side yard. The west side of the house. The island has virtually no street lights. There are no traffic lights. It is 7 miles long and three miles wide. Outside it was dark. There were multiple objects, all orange and hazy looking. They were everywhere. Hovering, bouncing. I also noticed that there was a light pulsating just like the first light I saw, only Due north. The three of us saw at least a dozen odd shapes performing many different feats. During this not one person walked past our house. Not one car drove past. Not one airplane flew overhead. This was strange because the Langdon House is on one of the ONLY main roads on the island. Less than a mile, SW, away is the Block Island Airport. The only way on or off the island is air or sea. It was a weekend and its usually a busy airport. The event ended at 9:15pm (eastern) according to my watch that evening and according to a clock radio in the room my companions shared on the second floor. Being keyed up by this nerve racking experience, the three of us walked less than a quarter mile down the hill to a local tavern, the Yellow Kittens. We left the house within fifteen mins if I recall correctly, after the event ended. When we got to the Yellow Kittens tavern the clock on the wall read 10:45pm. My wrist watch read 9:30pm.",

It was traveling from the east to the west. I know this since I was traveling north on Rte 91.  Two cars had just passed me on the highway and I know that they saw it too since they swerved in the passing lane in front of me just as I saw this object.  It was bright yellow/orange at the tip and neon green in the tail which was wider than the tip.  I did not see it dissappear over the horizon since I was too busy trying to make sure I didn't collide with the cars in font of me.  I saw only one mention of this object in the news the next night which was picked up by the Associated Press in my local newspaper.  I have watched the sky for most of my life and have never seen anything like this.  I have seen the comets in recent time - Hale Bopp and Halley's - but they looked nothing like this. More importantly, I have been seeing lights in the southeastern sky from where I live in northeastern VT for a few weeks.  They are clearly visible on a clear night.  I don't think that these lights are the normal star/planet sightings eventhough they are visible in the sky at dusk when the sky gets dark.  They seem to be suspended in the night sky at the tail of a constellation, which I cannot name since I don't know them that well.  They only move in the sky as the night goes on and as the constellation moves in the night sky.  The reason I feel they are different is that they appear to be flashing red, green and white lights.  This is visible clearly with binoculars.  They are much further out in the sky than any aircraft, because I have seen aircraft fly in the sky at altitudes that are are very high at the same time I am observing the flashing lights and the aircraft is far below these lights.  As the night progresses I can see other lights (not stars, I don't think) appear over the horizon from the northeast.  They seem to form a very large triangle in their positon in the night sky with this lower brighter object.  The two additional light points in the sky (also flashing colors) appear to be much further away than the one I can clearly see at dusk and thereafter. Can you tell me anything about them or has anyone else seen them?",

I could see the rush hour traffic going buy slowly across the highway is Mount St-Bruno, a little mountain in the St-Lawrence valley. I was back then a master mechanic for a General Motors dealership, and in my spare time am an avid aircraft watcher, since we have airports all over. I am now a video editor for a large television network, so i hope this is enough to show you that i am sure of what i saw, and it was nothing i have ever seen before. Except maybe once when i was 16 when a friend of mine and i where scared out of our wits by something overhead, but thats another story. So, to get back to the task at hand. I'm sitting in my car, my head turn left watching the ski hill on the mountain and the cars going buy on the highway.  To my right is the Dealer where i work. I turn my head front for a second and there it is, approx.200 feet from the ground hovering over the street just above the garage, a large red ball of light, i couldn't see a shape, more of a large glow. I couldn't believe it was i the only one seeing this, all those cars and those skiers. I got out of the car to get a better perception. There was no sound other than the traffic and that wasn't very noisy. Suddenly, the ball began to move over and across the highway very slowly. The thing was so large and so low i couldn't believe i was the only one seeing this, traffic kept moving and i was alone on the little street where i parked. It kept going until it reached a point just below the summet of the mountain in front of the lit ski hill, then al of a sudden it became a small point of red light, changed direction to follow the lenght of the mountain, then turned 180 degrees and headed for the ski hill again, then, this how i remember it, i saw the light fly over the ski hill still just below the summit, so i could see it very well, the it crossed the hill it then entered the woods beetween to light post at the top of the hill and then, just vanished. I have to tell you, my eyes never lied to me before, i was in going crazy thinking about it and going over it for weeks after that. To this day i don't know what i saw. I also have a couple of dreams that might interest you, well i think they where dreams.",

At your request as heard on the ART BELL radio program on 2/5/01, I am sending you MY UFO story...IT IS TRUE... I don't remember the exact date, but I AM POSITIVE it was in the EARLY 1980'S... My best friend and I, in our early 20's at the time, decided to go \"Back-Roading\" on a clear Summer, weekday night around 10:30 PM... We were out driving the country roads surrounding Red Wing, MN., traveling East in the vicinity of Whiterock, MN. when I, (The Passenger) , saw an unusually bright light, approximately 500-1000 Ft. Up &amp; 1-2 Miles North of us, that seemed to be moving South VERY slowly... We pulled off to the side of the road, turned OFF the engine, and got out of the car to get a better look... The \"Object \" was now almost directly above us and STATIONARY &amp; the bright light was now gone... We listened, but could hear NO SOUND at all coming from it... It appeared to be TRIANGULAR and very dark, If not Black...(Please Read On)... I took some small binoculars out of the glove box and looked at the object closer... I SAW a definite TRIANGULAR shape, but slightly angled inwards at the back, like the back end of an arrowhead... I also saw 5 LIGHTS on the Bottom of the object...Each a DIFFERENT COLOR, arranged in a CIRCLE, with the lights placed at points as the points of a star shape would be within a circle...The lights did NOT blink or fade On &amp; Off... I don't know what this thing was, but I DO know what it WAS'NT...A Plane OR a Helicopter... It just stayed there in the sky STATIONARY for approximately 5 MINUTES, and then SLOWLY moved Northwest... We got back in the car and followed it at about 10-20 MPH...to 40-50 MPH...Then to 80-90 MPH... It still outpaced us moving off Northwest untill within 30 seconds or so, it could not be seen... We slowed down &amp; went back home feeling Thrilled, Spooked, &amp; Thoroughly Mystified... We told only our close friends &amp; family about the sighting, fearing ridicule, and went on with life having no answers on the subject... Within a week we were busy trying to convince ourselves it HAD to be a plane or a helicopter, and we were starting to believe our excuses... A week after that, on the FRONT PAGE of our local newspaper, the Red Wing REPUBLICAN EAGLE, were sketches of the very object we had seen 2 weeks before... Apparently several eyewitnesses had seen this object floating at tree top level at various spots in an around Red Wing,MN. where we live... Needless to say, that ended our excuses...But, to this day I am sill left without answers... As I said, this sighting happened in the EARLY 1980's, and with a little help from our local newspaper, mabey you could get the exact date... Or they might still have the newspaper archived... Also, mabey ART BELL would be interested in this TRUE Story...?? Feel free to forward it to him if you like... Thanks for listening &amp; the IMPORTANT job you do!!",

We sat down for dinner.This seating area is outdoors and sits about three stories on a cliffside overlooking the beach and view is to the east. While having dinner I began to observe an apparent helicopter out on the ocean horizon with two very intensely brilliant search lights sweeping the water.I began to notice the other dinners pulling out cameras and mumbling to one another about this and taking many pictures. We finished eating and said goodnite to some friends and headed to room;all the while noticeing that the [helicopter]is slowly working its way towards shore and us. Now the layout of the resort is important.It is \"J\" shaped, in a cove,on the ocean,with thelong part juting out on a jetty which is where our room was. there is a break in between the building which alows you to get to the beach.We were right at this area about 30 feet from the water when al of a sudden we were lite up like Richard Druyfess in closs encounters of the third kind. I noted to my wife there is the helicopter.Less than 75 feet in the air and no more than 100 feet away.In amater of a few seconds I obseved the 2foot in dia.spotlite turn red as it began to fade of.As it is going out I see that the red color is the filement in the center of the lite and there is a flame coming off it.At the same time Inotice a gas orfice pulling away from the back of the lite and both the lite and gas line are retracting into the bottom of the craft.Also lights[small] are now apearing around the helicopter so I thought!With absolote excitement I now realize that I am looking at a 30 foot in dia. flying saucer, so closs I could hit it with a coffee cup.As I turn to my wife and say it , she is already gone, running scared and screaming for me to get away.I off course noway. I stayed riht there. I observed now that! it has rectangular windows around its perimeter,that everone having dinner above us on the cliff is takeing pictures like it was at arock concert and some were screaming.You see that I now notice that there are 3ET's near the windows. There were two to the right side of the saucer and they were WAVEING HELLO!, to the other people haveing ddinner and then I notice the one looking strate at me. I now know what it means to have your hair stand up on the back of your neck!!!!! It was the most fearfull thing I have ever felt in my life. They were the \"GRAYS\"; without a doubt!!!!!After about 1 minute with out any noise, it began to head out over the ocean. At about 150 yards out you could hear jets comeing. The British military began chasing them. And off they went out off site.The next morning just after 5a.m.,around sunrise my wife shakes me awake.\"A-----,she says I dont'know how to say this but a they wre just here.\"I said who???She tells me that someone just layed her down on the bed. When she oened her eyes there at the foot off the bed et was standing there It raised one hand and waved and lept right out out balcony door about 10 feet never touching the rail. I noted also that I was under the covers and she was on top off them....That day on the beach people said that we should have been there the night before there was a dozen [flying saucsers buzzing the island......",

This second sighting was in the later afternoon on a sunny, clear day in late May or early June of 1967. I don't know the exact date. We lived in the country on a small acreage. I was bringing in the groceries when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright, stationary light in the Northern sky about 30 - 45 degrees off the horizon. I turned to look at it - it was extremely bright, high in the sky and about the size to my eye of about 3 or 4 bright stars combined. As I watched it, another smaller, but just as bright light, came flying at an incredible speed out of the east, intersected with the larger light and they both moved flew up and away, again at incredible speed, and were quickly out of sight.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around objectI was out for a walk, when a ball of light came out of the north to the south and and changed direction straight upwards and reversed\n\r\nAbout 6 1/2 years ago I was working as a security guard at a distribution center for a well known retail store in the city of Wilkes-Barre, PA I was working at the truck enterance in a little guard shack. I decide to go out for a little walk to stretch my legs at about 21:30 (9:30pm). As I was walking west on the enterance road I happened to look up and saw a ball of light come out from behind a building to my right. This ball of light was a very bright white and was approximately 1 mile to the northwest of me about 300 feet in the air, possibly a little higher. The ball of light was traveling from the north to the south at a speed I would estimate at about 200-250 miles per hour. As the ball of light was approaching the centre city area, it all of a sudden did what I think to be a 90 degree turn and go straight up into the air for about 200-300 feet. This ball of light hovered for a second in one position and then came back down to its previous position and proceeded back off to the north towards Scranton, PA. By the time I got to where I can look to the north, the ball of light was gone and never saw it again. What I found very surprising is that the ball of light took the same track out that it came in on. There was no noise with this ball of light. It was just a ball of white light, no other colors in with it. There was no streak or trail behind it. I am not aware of anything in the world that can do such a perfect maneuver without some variation off of its track. I would estimate the size of this object to be like extending your arm and holding a little rubber super ball or a quarter in the air. I asked around to other people I was working with that night, if they saw anything but they said no. I know I was not seeing things. Some people say maybe your mind was playing tricks on you but I don't think that is it. Like I said, it was pretty early in the evening about 2130 hrs. There had to be other witnesses to this.",

As the object came closer it appeared to get larger, very bright, and spikes coming out of it. I was the passenger in the car, my brother driving. I couldn`t believe what I`m seeing, so I told my brother who is driving to look to right up the mountain. I needed him to view the object because his eyes are better than mine. He seen everything I did and confirmed what I was looking at. Of course I viewed it longer, because he had to drive. I was getting a little scared at what I was seeing because it was getting closer to us. Well we lost sight of it at that point, because of our distance traveling. We did see the object one more time about three miles more up the road, but at more of a distace away. Then if disapeared. I would say this object was at least, 300 yards in diameter. The strange part of all this is, we forgot about seeing this object. It wasn`t until 4 months later that it popped back into my head. I can home that day and asked my brother about it again, he said he forgot about it also, untill I had reminded him of the event. about me:I`m 44 years old and Iv`e worked for General Motors for the last 23 years, and I consider myself very level headed, as for my brother.",

            "characteristics": "Aircraft nearbyV-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix.\n\r\nOn a clear sunny day I observed what looked like a V-shaped silver craft approach Phoenix, Arizona, directly from the west. I watched it cross the \"valley of the sun\" for an hour. At the time I was at work. My desk was next to a window on the second floor of a building that was situated on the side of South Mountain. From my vantage point I could see the entire valley for 20 miles in every direction except south. I could also see dozens of aircraft approach or depart Sky Harbor airport all day long. When I first saw the V-shaped silver craft approach from the west, I at first thought that it was a specially designed aircraft coming into Sky Harbor. I pointed it out to a co-worker and asked him what he thought it was. He didn't know. Strangely, as the craft neared Sky Harbor, it veered to the north and skirted the airport. Both my co-worker and myself wondered out loud about the craft and where it was going. Fortunately, as the craft continued to fly due east it got closer to us. It completely bypassed the airport and continued east. Though we couldn't make out details, we noticed that the V-shape of the craft began to change and warp. We then realized that we were probably witnessing a flock of silver-backed ducks. They eventually disappeared out of sight still heading east. I only mention this because it may have a bearing on the V-shaped silver craft that was witnessed at night flying over Phoenix just a week later. I did not see the night sightings because I was in bed, since I had to work an early shift. Though I had seen ducks in flight, I puzzled over why they were heading east. After all, this is a desert, and most migratory birds fly north and south. A week later I found my answer. Thirty miles due east of Phoenix there's a town called Fountain Hills. In the middle of this desert community there's a huge man-made lake. In the middle of this lake lies the world's tallest fountain. I drove out there. Once I got to the lake, there were hundreds of ducks, all species. Brown, black, white -- and sil! ver. I c annot confirm that the V-shaped craft many people witnessed that one night in March, 1997, was a flock of ducks -- but it's the truth that I saw them migrating during the day just a week prior. My experience might help provide a logical answer to why the V-shaped craft proceeded over Phoenix at such as slow rate of speed. Most people usually report UFO's flying at a high rate of speed. By the way, the V-shaped craft, if I recall correctly, was also flying east. I know that this explanation might prove disappointing to UFO enthusiasts, but not all UFO's are alien. Some are of earthly origin provided by mother nature herself.",

But since yesterday morning, I haven't been able to get it out of my head. The way it happened, all seemed to perfect, to be real. First, I was driving home while listening to 640AM which was educating us, the people, of this website. I get home and go straight online to look up this site, (I am always eager to educate myself; currently reading the book Chaos- Making a New Science and I also read philosophy.) While I'm researching this site, my cordless phone gives off half a ring, mind you it's about 3:30am, and I was startled. Last year I had 3 strange incidents occur with both my home number and old cell number at about the same time. I even have witnesses for those incidents. (A sound like a baby's heart through an ultra sound.) So again, I was startled when my phone rang yesterday morning. I got off line quickly, and for some reason went to go look outside my kitchen window. That's when I saw the red and white lights coming forward, yet in sort of a side to side motion. I was thinking to myself, \"no way, this can't be happening.\" And continued to stare at the object to prove myself wrong of it's side to side motion. I went outside in my backyard and watched it fly over my house. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle because of the white lights at the front point of it and on each end of what would be it's wings. On the bottom, there were two red lights that seemed to be pulsating and made a quiet humming sound. I tried to analyze it as best as I could so I would then be able to confirm to myself, that it was only a plane. But I was unable because of a glare or something from the white lights. I have no idea whether it was a ufo or not, I only know that the nature of it, seemed unfamilar to me.",

In May of 2000 while coming back from delaware on the highway we were driving along when something had caught my eye in the sky. i looked up and noticed this craft maneuvering like no craft i have ever seen do before. it moved at a consttant speed, seemingly going the same speed as the car. so i pointed this to my friend and he was like what the....? then all of a sudden it jetted off at extremely high speeds. we couldn't believe our eyes. my friend told me he had never seen something like that before. i told him that i have but never during the day.",

We had driven about 3/4 of a mile from the valleys edge and pulled off onto an approach into a field and  we all got out to observe the sky. We were all just standing there when all of a sudden , one of my nephews yelled out \"What the heck is that?\" We looked off into the northwesr sky &amp; at about a 10:00 position were two \"Starlike \" objects , rotating around each other at a high rate of speed.  They did this for a few rotations and then one object took off in a westerly direction and the second object  sped off at a high rate of speed in an Easterly direction. These objects were a very long way off and seemed to be mixed in with the stars.  The second object was heading east at a high rate of speed and then seemed to slow down and  drop into an arch, or half circle pattern,   until it rseemed to reach it's original path and then it accelerated rapidly again in an Easterly direction. It proceeded like this for a short distance and then dropped into that pattern again and then back up into it's original path. It carried on doing this until it eventually went out of sight in the Eastern sky. I had  binoculars with me and even with them it appeared to be nothing more than a star gone crazy. The object travelled right across the sky  in this pattern until it disappeared. In the excitement of watching this , all four of us forgot all about the first object that had sped off  to the west .We don't know what type of flight pattern it took. My nephews, brother &amp; myself had never observed anything like this before or since. When we returned to our campsite my nephews, both teenagers, were so excited about this that they still talk about it to this day. I had no idea as to who we should report this to, or if we should, but after listening to Art Bell's show on Feb 5/01 I thought i! should report it for what it's worth. We know it was something out of the ordinary and were amazed at the way it manouvered.   My brother who was with us , and who has been employed by the Provincial government for nearly 30 years , was equally amazed at this and is convinced that it is nothing that was made on earth.",

We have been camping together for many years now, so with all the latenight fireside chats the need to Identify has occured. It was around 1:30 am when I first noticed a odd lingering greenish light moving SLOWLY over the treed hills. At first I thought It was smoke from fireworks, BUT when in full veiw the shape was too triangularly defined. I asked for an opinion and recieved confirmation that it was MORE! The last log was burning low enouph and approaching closer a STARTLING sight it was. Then my husband had to shine a bright flashlight at it and within 5 mins. It made a very clear change in direction OUR WAY. It reached the lake that we camp on and I began to PANIC, It was HUGE!!! (3\\4 or more the size of a football field) Uncontrollably shaking with tears in my eyes I went for witnesses. when we got back to the lake it was nearly over us. It had three lights, one on each corner the front light was the brightest. The area between each point was a translucent greenish\\blue color. It made a strange two tone subsonic type low hummmmmminggg sound. Heading N.West it moved rythmaticly with a soft up\\down appearance at the frant of it. I was SOOO scared, all in total AWE we had to sit. At about 3:00 am it was over the sand dunes, but thankfully past us. Allthough still in uor sights everyone was very tired and wanted to retire for the night. I could not take my eyes off of it, I watched it from our moterhome window. At around a 3:45/4:00 am it dissappeared with a sheetlightning or Giant camera FLASH. On our way home we stopped by a favorate place to dine in a nearby town Mapleton OR. we noticed that the paper mentioned it. When we returned from our vacation, We reported our \"sighting\" to the Unsolved Mysteries &amp; Sightings Websites. This was in 1997 and I cant seem to get it off of my mind. If anyone else has seen or heard simular reports. PLEASE POST IT!!! Sometimes I feel so alone in the effect it had on me. In ways I w! ish that I could pass it off as a Military thing as I have other pacullar flying crafts, but I DONT BELIVE THAT! As far as our personal backgrounds...

My mom yelled down the stairs \"Katie did u see that light out of your window\".  I thought she meant something in the yard but she said look over the mountain in the sky.  So i llooked out my window downstairs which faces the mountain and i looked at it.  It was very bright. My mom thought it was a planet but after taking astronomy i am pretty sure with the visible eye a planet is not that bright or close to the earth.  So i took my mothers pretty strong binoculars, and looked through them.  The object was white colored and looked like many dots put together.  It was outlined in thin red.  It wasnt visibly moving yet it did look like it was a little more North then when we first saw it.  It got lower and lower as the half hr or so went on. Again we couldnt see it drop but it got lower. At 8:30 it finally dropped on the other side of the mountain and it was no longer visible to us here.  I tried to take pictures and draw some quick sketches but i realized as i kept observing it that it changed shape.  It was somewhat of a disc shaped a little deformed,, then it looked more like a cigar, then it looked round.  The shape looked like it was a formation of lights but it was definetly something i have never seen before.  My mom said maybe it was a sattelite but again it was pretty clear and visible to be a satelite.  My mom and I both believe in UFO's but i wasnt planning on \"looking\" or seeing any tonight.  For me to write a report about it means that i really do believe it was something.  It did not look like a planet, nor has the sky been very visible lately.  It was not a airplane,, but it is possible it could be a satellite im really not sure. It eventually dropped lower to the horizon and over the mountains so we were not able to see anymore,\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect they may have been observing Venus, but that is just a guess.

The object had apparently zoomed off into the distance before I got into the room.

I went outside to check to see if I could still see it, but by that time it was gone.  I came back upstairs and looked out the window again, where I could see a small pin prick of red light floating in the distance.

First, there were distinct flashing colored lights (red, green, maybe blue)around the perimeter of the light, blinking on and off. Most importantly was it's movement - it would move quickly from right to left or up and down (or vice versa) and then come to a dead stop before immediately dashing off in another direction at a 45 degree angle. This was observed by my college roommate and myself while we attended Grand Valley State College in Allendale, MI (near Grand Rapids). We first noticed the \"star\" moving through the night sky while we driving back to our dorm. I thought at first it might be an illusion, because we were driving, but then my roommate (who was the driver) mentioned it to me. We stood in the parking lot outside our dorm and watched it moving, occasionally confirming to each other which way we observed it moving, just to make sure that we were both really seeing this thing. We watched for about 15 to 20 minutes before going inside, the object still doing it's manuevers in the sky.

It hung in the air and several people witnessed.\n\r\nIt was about 7:30 this December night. Not particularly cold outside. Directly north of my house, I looked up to see a mysterious, glowing cloud. It was eerie because it was cloudy that evening, slightly foggy. I was leaving the house to go to our bookmobile as we do almost every Thursday night. When I saw it, I couldn't believe that this glowing formation was real. It made no sound. The air was crisp and it carried no sound. I went running back in to call my boys to come and see, that took at least 30 seconds and it was still there when we came outside to see it. We gazed at it for at least two minutes. It looked quite close, close enough to see the shape of the light emitted from within the formation. It was oval, a long oval that wasn't defined. It was almost like, being close enough behind a curtain, that the people on the other side can see your shape, but not you. If I held me arm out at shoulder length, I would say it was the length of my thumb. Up high in the sky at about 45% angle. Low enough to see that it's close, but not so close. It looked like it could've been 1/2 away, but because of the formation and the play of light, it could be much farther away. We couldn't see what made the light. We started walking and I saw a beam come out from the top,  it stopped for a split second. Then the beam went to the 10 0'clock position. Again, paused for a slit second and then went to 8 0'clock. It paused there and moved to six o'clock. It then retraced it's steps and the beam at midnight shot back into the cloud from whence it came. It then just melted away. It was gone quickly. The beam was perpendicular all the way along. It did not seem to start out as a slit and then become a circle which becomes wider as the beam lengthened. The end of the beam being much wider than the spot from which it originates. Of course, when we got to the bus, I told at least three people what I had seen and about four of us were talking about the glow, \"oh you saw it too!\". Only one lady saw the beam, just the way I saw it. We knew it was otherworldly, but we thought it was weird that we couldn't figure out what had made it.",

My cousin and I, both 13 at the time, observed a large round \"saucer\" type object over the highway while staying at a nearby campground. The object was observed while gathered around a campfire. We were singing songs with approximately 10 other \"campers\". It was about 8:00 in the evening. Someone noticed the object in the sky and we all stopped singing and became entranced with the object. It was very Large, perhaps 100 yards wide, and had lights all around it. (It looked like a \"UFO\" looks in most hollywood movies) The object just hovered over the highway and campground for what seemed to be a half hour or more. In that time no one said a word and we all were motionless and entranced with the object. The few cars that were on the highway at the time the object appeared had come to a complete stop and no other cars appeared. It seemed as tho time were standing still ...other than the fact that we could plainly see the object and that we were aware of our surroundings. After the object began to move away, everything went back to \"normal\". The singing was started again and the cars on the highway took off. No one mentioned the object we had just seen. Later that night, I woke up and got out of our tent to use the restroom. I then observed the object several miles away in the sky, did my business, then just went back to sleep. My cousin and I did not discuss this at all until approximately 5 years later. (and have since discussed it about every 5 years or so) We both recalled seeing it and all the same details of the \"sighting\", and, to this day we are 100% convinced that we what we seen was most definitely some form of \"alien\" spacecraft. We did not see little green men and don't recall being \"abducted\" but we are sure this happened and would like others to know!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

When the light went off I thought the plane had left somehow but then 3 lights came on and the object then appeared to be triangular, with a light on each corner, one red, one green, and one white.  The lights were blinking and then appeared to dissappear totally.  It should be noted the duration of the entire event we never heard any sound as to whether there was an engine in the craft or not.

My friend suggested it might be a wing-light to a plane that was turning directions or something, but as he said that, the lights dimmed and began moving quickly in different directions. They were moving pretty fast and eventually they began following each other but at a distance, changing to much dimmer lights. They were not planes. I know that.

It was early evening but still quite dark.  The moon was visible and next to it venus (I presume).   \n\r\nAs I looked at the moon I noticed what appeared to be 3 small stars (very dim and white in color).  On closer observation I noticed an outline of a dark spherical craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and very high in the sky but was clearly outlined. the little lites changed briefly from 3 to 5 and then back the lights were on the bottom of the craft.  The craft was motionless and seemed to just hang there. \n\r\nThis thing must have been huge!  There was no sound or any motion.  \n\r\nI pointed the craft out to my friend and she glanced up and said that she thought that i was seeing stars.  \n\r\nWe drove to my moms house and I pointed it out to my mother who was able to see the crafts outline as well.  It had remained in place for the entire 20-30 minutes that I observed it. \n\r\nThe following night and for the last week I have been looking for it and haven't seen it or any small grouping of stars that should have been present if that was all I was seeing.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else has had a simular sighting. \n\r\nI expected that a UFO would be bright and saucer shaped not spherical and dark.  I had the feeling that it didn't wish to be observed and that it was observing something --- there is a great deal of military stuff in the springs like NORAD and the SDI-testbed and the consolidated space operations center etc..\n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date apparently is approximate.

The object myself and passenger witnessed was EXTREMELY bizarre and unlike anything either of us have ever seen both in person or on a UFO tv documentary. Was a very bright white light in the sky that both moved about slowly in the sky 2 - 5,000 feet up and also hovered absolutely motionless above us for minutes at a time.  The object also displayed very peculiar behaivior as described:  Completely dissappeared for approx. 2 seconds at a time on 3 separate occassions (or at least turned off all lights), eminated Red 'spikes' or short lasers of light which were very defined and not diffused light.  These were arbitrarily 'turned off and on' at different points of the sighting.  These spikes appeared to be in somewhat of an X form around the object and defintely moved or spun about the object.  Additionally, a white spike or laser type light  that appeared to acutally be 2 parallel lights projected out from the object in a downward direction.  These extended about 5 times the size of the object but did not go any further and also would be arbitrarily turned off and back on at different points. We witnessed the object about 10-20 miles south of Baker, CA and pulled off the side of the road to observe it for about 15min. as it hovered motionless in movement, but displayed the active lighting characteristics of the 'spike lasers' as it hovered.  Estimated distance from us was maybe 10 miles or so.  The object had no regularly flashing beacon lights as a domestic craft almost always does and it was much brighter than any aircraft i have ever witnessed at night or brighter than any star or other objects in the sky.  Visibility was clear with a full sky of stars.  Partial moon i believe was out because we could see the horizon of the small mountains in the surrounding area. Please reply to let me know of any similar reports or findings on this date. Thank you. Sincerely, ((name deleted))",

It was still dark, and there was a very bright full moon.  As I was about a tenth of a mile from my apartment building on Bushman Street, Oakton, Virginia I looked at the moon which was bright and low on the horizon.  To the left and below of the moon I saw an amber colored light moving slowly from right to left, approximately over the A T &amp; T regional headquarters building compound.  At first I thought that it was an airplane taking off from Dulles Airport which is about twenty miles away in that direction but I realized that it was far too low on the horizon for it to be an airplane and it seemed to me that it was almost at tree top level.  I realized that it was quite near. I made a right turn on to Borge street and noticed that the object had turned towards my vehicle.  It blinked or pulsated once, and then held a steady amber color. It seemed to stop and hover over the edge of a small childrens playground.  At that time I had turned left onto Jermantown road and had to concentrate on my driving,though I was still looking towards my left where it was hovering about 200 feet away, at the height of a street lamp or so. I had to get gasoline and after that, about ten minutes later I again passed the spot where I had seen this object, and it was no longer there.  At first I thought that maybe I had seen a street lamp or something as it was earlier for me than usual but the object was no longer there on my second pass by the area, so that was not it. Nor could it have been the full moon as I had seen both at the same time. The object seemed to be a small glowing sphere or so, maybe the size of a basket ball though this is very difficult to ascertain.",

I was taking my husband to work.  It was on a road with little traffic during the day and none at that time of the morning.  There were areas of dense trees on either side of the roadway and large high tension electrical poles on one side of the road.  There was absolutely no traffic at that time of the morning.  As we rounded the bend to go into the main entrance to his worksite, we spotted an object that resembled a chandelier with many tiny white lights.  The moment I said, \"What the hell is that?\" the lights instantly turned red.  At that point it moved away from the electrical pole and slowly glided or drifted away.  I wanted to observe it further but my husband was in a rush to get to work on time.  After I dropped him off and went back out I tried to see if it was still there, but it wasn't.  It was definitely intelligently controlled, but did not feel threatened by it.  I was amazed and exhiliated.  It appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in total diameter, in an oval or round shape with protrusions with white lights on it.  It was quite dramatic and beautiful.  I believe this object was a \"probe\" of some type.  As we approached it appeared to be absorbing power from the tension line.

We both noticed a glowing light over our heads that would split into four distinct balls of light through the clouds, cirle counterclockwise and then converge back to a central ball of light.  This convergence was like a quick kiss and then the four individual balls of light would wisk out to the outer circumference and do a circle dance counterclockwise and repeat the movement to the the center kiss/convergence and out again in seperate forms of light.  Whatever this was-it must have been very high up because it truely seemed to follow us.  We stopped at several houses and collected several neighbors observations, as well. They saw the same thing, as well. I did report this to our Rochester Planetarium and was promised they would get back with some possible explainations.

On this particular evening I was in the basement when I felt a low rumble, I dismissed it at first thinking it was just a passing jet, but when it continued past a minute or so, I went upstairs to investigate.  I had personally seen and heard of many strange things from the farm kids around town, but I had never seen anything like this.  It was a sort of triangular shaped craft that didn't appear to be more than 50 feet above the roof line of houses, and hovered with quite a bit of force exerted on the ground, yet with little sound (if that makes sense when written).  I watched the object for another 20-45 seconds hover, or slowly advance, and then it left extrememly quickly out of sight, not up to space, but straight along the plains towards Garden City.  As I have said, I had watched the aircraft on the flight plan since I was 7, and have never seen an aircraft behave like this, Perhaps this is an undiscovered hotspot?  It makes sense to me in the fact that Western Kansas has little population and most people are on farmers' hours (early to bed, early to rise) after 10pm, life all but ceases to exist.  Also, with a large stretch of flat lands and hardly anything above a two story building, it would be easy to move low to the ground and avoid radar.  Something to check out perhaps?",

I assumed it was a planet as it is usually where we see what we believe to be venus (to the west) It was so bright though, I thought I would make a note of where it was in the sky, and see if it would move. For the first half hour or so, it remained stationary. After that however, I started to notice it slowly moving to another part of the sky. It was very suttle to someone who might just be looking up, but it was definitely moving. It didn't seem to be of conventional origin for the mear fact that it moved so slowly. I was watching it by myself until my wife came in the room. She usually poo-poo's the idea of UFO's but when she saw it and saw it was moving, it kind of spooked her. We had binoculars handy so we watched it and saw a better view of the object. It was very bright, and every so often would change to part red. Sometimes more red than white. Now we knew it wasn't venus- plus it had moved so far. It took a little over an hour for the object to finally disappear over the mountain. When I first viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared as a huge ball of light. I could not see any indication that it was a conventional craft. I am not an expert, and have only seen something peculiar one other time, but this one stumps both my wife and I. Please let me know if someone else saw this object or somehow this can be explained away. I am a believer, and for all I know, this thing has been sitting there before and I just didn't take the time to watch it. I would be very interested in knowing if others saw it.",

I was home on leave from the Coast Guard, and was visiting my mother and step-father who lived on a farm. Earlier in the day I went to visit a friend on his farm. My friend's farm is located in a hollow area between two hills, therefore I couldn't see much of the surrounding sky. I drove east 1.5 miles to a road that runs north and south. When I turned to go north, I started looking around, and noticed a bright white light low in the southwestern sky. The evening was crystal clear, because we had an ice storm the night before, and the night after an ice storm is usually clear. At first I thought it was an aircraft moving toward me with its landing lights on. To the southwest is Eppley Airport in Omaha, Nebraska, and Offut Air Force Base which is near Omaha. I am also an amature astronimer, and I know there were no planets or bright stars in that area of the sky on that date. I stopped the car and watched the light for a few minutes, then I drove onto the next road and turned west. As I drove home, I noticed when I crested the top of each hill, the light was still in the southwest. The object didn't appear to have moved any, because I took visual measurements using the farm yard lights near the object. When I got home I took out the binoculars, and tried to see if I could make out what it was. All I could see was a very bright white light. I put the binoculars in the house, and went back outside to watch the light. My step-father came out of the house, and wanted to go to town. The town he wanted to go to is Shelby. As we drove west down the hill I saw the bright white light go out, and the object turned to what appeared to be a reddish glow which appeared to envelop the object.  The object went from a standstill to a very high rate of speed in just a few seconds. I watched it travel north and inside of a minute or two it was gone. I said to my step-father that the bright white light that I had been watching was acting strange. It was bright white and dead still one second, then it turned red and sped off in the next second. I said to my step-father the U.S. doesn't have any aircraft that can do that. He who is one not to believe in anything strange unless it can be proved, said it was just an airplane or something. I thought it was an \"or something\". The next day on the front page of the Council Bluffs Nonpariel newspaper was a story about the object I had seen the night before. A woman was driving with her children down a country road to her father-in-law's house to stay with him, because her house didn't have any electricity. The woman said she was driving west and saw the object. She said that when she went over the next hill, she drove right under the object. She said when she drove under the object the bright white light went out, it turned red and sped off to the north. This is occured exactly at the same time I was watching it. I will never forget this sighting as long as I live.",

As it grew closer we could see that it was semi-circular in profile and had windows with silhoulettes of figures in the windows. It stayed motionless for around 7 to 8 minutes and was about 300 yards away from us. I would say that the size of the craft in relation to the size of the figures was around 400 feet across. After a period of time I motioned for the craft to come closer but it shook from side to side three times as if to say \"no\". It stayed where it was for approx 30 secs after this and then flew from its position towards the horizon and disappeared within 5 or 6 seconds.

I thought at first that it was a head light to a plane moving toward us through the trees as we got closer to the light I started telling my daughter that it looks like a bright star or planet. As we drove down the road it seemed to follow us just above the trees . I stopped the car and rolled down the window to listen for any sound .There was no sound. I continued down the road passed the turn home because I could not believe what we where seeing . We came to the end of the road where we stopped to look at this bright star when it flickerde out of sight. At that time my daughter was tired and when I got excieted about the incident and suggested that it was a UFO she quickly stated that we han seen a comet. We went home and told every one about what we thougt was a comet . The reason I say that is I saw the bright star again tonight about the same time as the last encounter. I was on my way over to my sisters house and noticed the bright star again. I could not resest driving back down the same road to look at it again. This time it was just hovering in the sky like agreat big star. Iwent to my sisters house and told them to take a ride with me to see this awsum star . this would be 20 minutes or so later. the star had changed its position. My sister and her children could not believe how big and bright the star was and as we watched ,it would become real bright and then fade alittle we watched it slowly move out of sight. Wedrove to a small private air port to ask if they had witnessed any thing but it was closed. I came home to share the experience with my family and of course my husband thinks that I am nuts. I decided to get on the net to find information on the reporting of UFOs and here I am. We are located near a Navy nuclear power plant , is it possible that it could be related?",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Left a trailA kite-shaped object with white lights in each corner was seen flying over central Boise and toward Meridian.\n\r\nFeb. 5 2001. Boise Idaho. When driving southeast on Chinden Blvd at approximately 6:40 PM I noticed a set of two very bright lights about  10-20 degrees above the horizon that at first appeared to be stationary. My first impression was that this was a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on. After a minute or so I noticed the aircraft was not following the normal airport approach. (I live near the airport and have a good feel for the normal arrival and departure patterns as well as the appearance of various aircraft at night.) The aircraft proceeded in what appeared to be a straight line over Garden City directly toward west Boise. (Plotting the flight path on a map indicates that the object passed virtually directly over the state capitol building downtown.) As the object approached, a white strobe light between the two \"landing\" lights became visible. For a moment I got the impression that an aircraft was in trouble and considering Chinden as a possible landing strip. Then I got the impression that the object could possibly be a slow moving blimp or perhaps I was approaching a balloon over the fairgrounds. (I was searching for rational explanations that I dismissed one by one.) I was stopped at the intersection of Chinden and Kent Ln. (next to the fairgrounds) when the object passed overhead and to my left. I was able to roll down my car window and look up at the object. It consisted of four white lights (two bright ones on the \"wingtips\", one strobe on the \"nose\" and a dim one on the \"tail\"). There were no conventional (red/green) aviation lights. There was no additional \"low flying jet\" noise above the normal traffic noise.  I caught a glimpse of the vehicle body as it passed in front of an upper level haze lit by moonlight and it appeared to be black and diamond shaped with four white lights at the tips. It was about 1 thumb width (at an arms length) from wingtip to wingtip. It also appeared to be leaving behind a vapor trial that was about the same width. It was difficult to estimate the altitude, and whether it wa! s ascend ing or descending.  Unfortunately, I could not observe the shape at length because the traffic light changed. At this point, the object clearly seemed peculiar, so I made a U-turn when I could and attempted to pursue it in the direction of its travel. The rear light was dim and the object was much more difficult to make out from the rear. I noted once again that the normal red and green navigation lights that would otherwise clearly mark a conventional aircraft from the rear were absent. The object seemed to move away and disappear much more rapidly than it approached (Probably because the brighter \"forward facing\" lights made it visible from farther away.) It disappeared over the rim of a ridge above Chinden. My total observation time was approximately 5-10 minutes. Two acquaintences of mine mentioned the next day that they also noticed some strange lights. One was traveling west on I-84 approximately 7-10 miles SW of my location. She reported that she saw strange lights moving west and south of the freeway, about 20 degrees above the horizon. The direction and time are consistent with my observations. I also monitored the sky at the same time on subsequent evenings to verify that this was not part of a routine daily jet flight. While preparing this report, I conducted a casual search of your database for similar sightings and found the following report with a description that matched what I saw: Occurred : 12/28/2000 18:00 (Entered as : 12/28/00 18:00) Reported : 1/5/2001 18:30 Posted : 1/28/2001 Location : Holyoke, MA Shape : Diamond \"\u2026 described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points\u2026\" That describes exactly what I saw. I'm a 44 year old electrical engineer who works for a well known high-tech company. I'm not fully convinced I observed an unconventional vehicle, but I do know that I saw what appeared to be an uncommon shape with a definite lack of red/green aviation lights on a strange flight path. I'm posting this in the event that it provides any additional useful information in combination with what others have seen.",

For those of you familiar with Winnipeg it occured in South St.Vital on Warde Ave and St.Annes Rd. I was the passenger in a friends car. As we were driving I looked to my right and noticed some bright lights over top of some houses. I thought about what I had seen and requested that we turn around and investigate. As we approached the object we noticed that it had 3 distinct lights in the form of a triangle. One on top and two to its sides. The lights seemed to have some color to them, at times I remember seeing hints of blue and red, but white was the most frequent. The object just seemes to hang there. It was no further away then 200 yards and was no higher than 50 ft. It hovered motionless for a few minutes. Meanwhile we were fiddling with the radio and flashing our headlights at it. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. Soon thereafter it proceeded top move in a South easterly direction. The lights were always visible. It seemed to move backwards. We proceeded to move east on the road we were on to try and intercept the object. We made it to a road which went North-South and turned south and then just stopped. The object was hovering over the road in front of us. Maybe 20-30 ft above the road and 200-300 yards away. It hovered, slowly moving backwards by some trees lining the road. At that point I rolled my window down and stuck my head out to listen....dead silence. There were no other cars on the road. We must have sat there 5 mins until it started to move in the direction in which it had come from. So we quickly turned around and headed down the same road we were on before only this time we were following a moving target. The lights were still visible at this point. The object seemed to accelerate quickly. We were doing about 80 -90 km/hr when it out accelerated us and vanished. I have never seen anything accelerate like that before. It was fast. I will never forget that night. We were 19 and 20 years old and we were not under the influence of any substanc! es. We w eren't tired and we definately were not dreaming.....Thanks for providing me with a place to post my encounter.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Heading East/Southeast above and just South, if not directly above Interstae 264 (formerly Route 44) there was an \"object\" which was diamond shaped and had 4 red lights on each \"corner\" flying relatively low to the ground and absolutely silent. I would say it was probably a half mile up in the sky and about a half mile away from where I witnessed it. This  \"object\" was moving so slow! If it were a plane, it would have fell from the sky! No planes fly this slow. I couldn't beleive it! Its lights were not blinking or rotating. They were solid red and stayed in the same posistion for the duration that I witnessed it. When I first saw it, It was just a red light in the sky that was slowly getting closer to me as time passed. As it got closer into view, I could easily make out its shape. It passed my view roughly a half mile from me. Last night was a chilly night with absolutely no wind at all. It was completely still outside except for the very faint sound of occasional traffic in the distance from the interstate. If it had any moving parts or a combustable engine on it...I would have heard it! With the angle that I had witnessed this (about 30 degrees), it was a solid object, and the diamond shape of it was very distinct. After it passed out of my view I ran outside to get another perspective while I still had the chance and was able to witness it again for about another 10 seconds as it silently passed out of my view for good. I do live in a city which has a lot of Military and flying aircraft which practice out of Oceana Naval Air Station which is is the general direction that this \"object\" was heading, but I see and hear these jets all the time as anyone who lives near me will say too. This was not a fighter jet! Nor was it a helicopter. Before I witnessed this \"object\", I could hear plain as day other aircraft in the far distances which were miles away! This thing was within \"rifle range\" of me and wasn't making a sound. Every aircraft that I have ever seen in my lifetime has had at least one blinking (beacon) light on it, and/or at least one white light. What kind of \"craft\" flies around with 4 solid red lights on it, and no beacon light?! Lastly, and most certainly, I mentioned that this \"object\" was roughly travelling over the interstate highway...well the vehicles which were occasionally travelling in the same direction as this thing (east/southeast) were moving much faster in the same general direction than the \"object\"! So my guess is that it was probably moving at about 30-50 mph.",

The lights were like looking at a well lit city from an airplane where all lights were of the same color and intensity. The formation was a wide angle V taking at least a 10 degree angle of arc, tip to tip. There were more lights in the apex of the formation and these tapered off at the tips. All objects were in a tight formation, travelling at the same speed. the lights of were of equal brightness.

I am interested in the stars and as such I glanced up at the sky.  I saw what I believed to be a passenger plane flying west.  A few seconds later I witnessed an additional object flying directly toward the first.  I knew that the distance between the two would be great by differences in altitude.  Still, I watched off and on until they met.  Then amazingly enough, the second light stopped and reversed direction to follow the first.  Immediately, I stopped the car. I rolled down the widow to hear what I figured to be a low flying helicopter.  I heard no sound.  Then, the second light accelerated and began flying circles around the first.  As I watched in awe, the first light continued on its trajectory while the second stopped again.  When I took a wider view of the sky, I discovered not just one object but between thirty and fifty similar sized lights of varying colors.  They all appeared to be flying in what one could determine to be geometrical shapes.  I told my brother to get out and look.  We both stood in amazement for about five minutes watching the aerial display.  Then being only two miles from home and my small telescope, we drove on.  When we got home, we looked up to see if they were still there and discovered another light.  This light was much larger, white, and stationary.  The smaller lights would fly to the larger one, stop, and then resume the geometric ballet.  I went inside to get my telescope and my father.  My father, argueably the most skeptical man in the world, was speechless as he witnessed the show. I tried to get a better look with my telescope, but they only appeared as bright lights. After about a half an hour, they just diappeared.  I realize that this may seem odd to report five years after the event, but I had no idea who to contact until now.  I will not wager a guess as to what we saw but it is deffinately worth reporting. At the time of the event I was seventeen, my br! other tw elve, and my father forty one. I graduated valedictorian of my high school class, played several sports, attended church, and was active in community activities.

I caught part of the program on the radio today on Coast to Coast.  So now I scambled onto my computer after work and searched for the program info.  But I actaully found Arts web page and the entire broadcast from this mornings show.  I am in Toronto Canada. Let me also include that I am an amature astronomer as well, so I can tell the difference from planets, stars, satalites, meteorites and so on. But this was a daytime sighting. Here is my sighting. It was a partly cloudy day, I believe it was August/September (chestnuts were ready to pick) 1974 I believe.  I was 13. My brother and I were out on a chestnut hunt looking for chestnuts.  We were on our way back from gathering chestnuts from a farm just outside the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada.  It was about 4pm.  After we came out of the farm field we walked down a road (walking northeastwards)  I looked and saw this object above the trees directly ahead of us.  It was about 400 feet or so away from us, it was moving very slowly towards us and up but slightly moving to our right.  It was triangular shaped.  From my position it was about the size of a baseball diamond.  Silvery/ grey in colour, it was raised in the centre, it was very smooth looking.  It made no sound at all.    I don't recall seeing any kind of windows.   It slowly moved upwards and went through the clouds and that is were I lost sight of it.  I saw it for about 4 or 5 minutes. When we got home I told my mother what we I saw.  My mother put the radio on and there were other reports of this sighting on the radio. Thank you for your time.

The object was moving at a slow rate heading in the direction of the Mississippi river.

If anyone else saw that object in the New Orleans area please report it.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  He had the presence of mind to call the object to the attention of other witnesses, and his description of the object was quite precise.  We do not know what it was he witnessed, but similar objects have been reported to NUFORC.  An object, apparently similar in appearance, was reported from Houston, TX, on the morning of 08SE00.

My husband took the eldest son to the local shop, should have been away about 20 minutes. He did not return until about four hours later we were getting worried over the two of them.  Then he returned and we wanted to know where he had been, his reply was to the shop.  He did not realise how long he had been away.  Then my son started talking about where he had been, he described somemen and what I realised later was very much like the inside of a space ship.  He did say what the men had done but to be honest I cant remember that bit. This child was too young less than 3 years old at the time so he had no prior knowledge to draw from.  It has been on my mind ever since and I am glad that I have told you now at least I have shared the experience.  He was not harmed in any way but was always intelligent as a child.  Shortly after their return we saw an object in the sky it was a cigar shape at first but then it turned and was a cicular shape as you imagine a ufo really it turned and was gone in a flash.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date and time are approximate.  NUFORC has received many reports that are similar to this one.  We do not understand how young children, who apparently have had little or no exposure to the UFO phenomenon, can apparently possess seemingly detailed knowledge about the specifics of the subject.

It was quite high up, and appeared to be a bright star.  But, the object darted back and forth, keeping in the same general area of the sky.  It being July 4th, we initially dismissed it as some sort of fireworks, but the object remained, nearly straight above us for at least an hour and a half.  It continued it's behavior of darting back and forth for the duration of the sighting.  It appeared to make some subtle color changes (orangish to reddish to purplish) but we can't be sure.  We could have been staring at it for a long time causing our eyes to play tricks on us (I'm a natural skeptic) but if I was forced to answer; I say it did.  The sky was cloudless and there was no wind, and no sound emitted.  I recorded it on my video camera but with the absence of background stars it gives almost no evidence of it's behavior.  It only shows a light in the sky.  Also, after an hour of observing, we heard the sound of jet aircraft but none were sighted.  They (or it)were probably under the treeline (we were in a heavily wooded campground) out of our line of sight.  My campmate claims he saw something eject from the object, but I did not witness that.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The report is reminiscent of the sighting of a celestial body, but that is only a guess.  NUFORC received multiple reports of a peculiar red light, sighted from Tacoma, WA, which is reported to have hovered over Puget Sound for an estimated 7 minutes, and which then was seen to suddenly accelerate and disappear over the mountains to the east in a matter of a few seconds.

I first noticed it around midnight, and watched it move all over the southwestern sky until I went to bed around twelve fourty. The observation occured on the northeastern end of the city, almost to the foothills of Roxy Ann.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the witness observed a celestial body, a star or a planet, but we are not certain.

My sighting was made in the parking lot of my apartment building on a very clear early night sky. Traveling in a more or less straight line from west to east were two lights in close proximity, one red, one white. They were blinking on and off in rapid stroboscopic fashion. As they moved at a fairly fast rate of speed (faster than a jetliner trailing contrails) the lights moved in unison in rapid jinking or zig zag movements along the straight flight path axis. The very swift directional zig zags veered of the flight path axis about 20 degrees above and below the flight path. Directional movement angles were extremely high, approximately 60 to 90 degrees every one or two seconds. I watched these lights move along the fairly straight flight path for approximately 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the roofline of my apartment building. What caught my eye away from the bright light of Venus was the rapid and severe directional zig zags of the lights as they moved forward. Their changes in direction were instantaneous. I've never seen a light or discernible object in the sky make such quick movements. There was no shape or object visible in the darkening sky, only the white and red lights moving as a unit. I am a writer and illustrator who specializes in aviation and space technology and history. I've had 6 books published on the history and technology of aircraft and 8 books on space exploration technology/history and astronomy. I am very knowledgeable about the flight capabilities of existing (officially acknowledged)aircraft and spacecraft. No current aircraft or spacecraft is capable of the very quick directional movements that I observed. I don't know what the lights were, but they were not the lights of any known vehicle. This is my first UFO sighting and was quite a surprise to me considering the extremely mundane sighting environment and conditions. I am wondering if there have been any other reports from this region on the date and time described?",

A woman who sounded like she was in her late 30's-early 40's called in to ask if anyone else had reported an unusual light in the west. The station's talk show host disregarded the caller, but I ran outside and looked to the west. It was a very clear night sky. Low on the western horizon was a very bright light that was magnitude 1 in brightness compared to the rest of the night sky. It was very slowly drifting to the north-northwest. After getting a winter jacket, I ran from my backyard to a better vantage point. I positioned myself on the Capital Blvd. bridge over I-5 and sighted the object in the west. It was just sitting low on the horizon and after a few minutes, it would drift north and then stop again. The bright light was white in nature with an impression of red, but at my distance it was difficult to tell. I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft taking off from the Olympia airport to the south and I noticed that several planes had taken off, but changed their flight patterns from the normal pattern that would have taken them within close proximity of the object in the west. The planes were all banking sharply to the northeast. After about 10 minutes, the object had drifted behind some evergreens in the foreground. I decided to run back home for a pair of binoculars. Upon reaturning the object was no longer in view from the bridge. I changed position but still didn't see the object again. I did notice that several more aircraft had taken off and still they veered to the east. I thinking that since I heard of this object on the radio I'm not the only person who witnessed this light. I know that there was at least one other person; the woman who tipped off the radio listeners that Monday night.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We believe the witnesses were observing Venus in the western sky.

The first day the object actually came straight down from above the volcano and looked somewhat like a huge silverish colored cylinder. It took at least 15 minutes to make the descent and when it impacted Popo, whoever was manning the live cam actually zoomed in on the explosion. The next day I saw the same type of thing, only this time there was no explosion, though it looked like it would have impacted the top of the volcano. Then this morning I checked the live cam for any increased volcanic activity and couldn't believe it when I saw a disk shaped silvery colored object, at least the size of a huge jet or football field, approach from the left side of the screen. It hovered over the volcano at about a 45 degree angle for at least fifteen minutes, and once again, I captured the still pictures. The object today actually hovered up there in the steam and smoke directly above the crater for a long time, so I captured a total of 50 pictures of the thing. Each picture is about 25K so would have to be emailed separately, but I would send them to you if you're interested. This is from the Cenapred live cam and each captured picture has the date and time on it by Cenapred so you can see how long it stayed over the volcano, before it simply vanished. Please email me if you'd like any of the pics. I have series from 3 days in a row now. If not, you might want to watch the Popocatepetl live cam for yourself. I am concerned, because if this is some kind of attempt to control the volcano, it could have repercussions in other areas, affecting earthquakes, or at least the movement of magma below ground. Could they be experimenting? And what kind of craft could hover up there right over the volcano in those extreme temperatures and air currents for long periods of time without being destroyed???<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The witness was kind enough to send us digital still images of what she apparently has observed over the webcams.  The tiny objects seen, and photographed, over the volcano appear to us to be short contrails behind high-flying jet aircraft.  However, if the estimate of 35 minutes' duration is accurate, that does not appear to be consistent with aircraft, which would be out of the field of view of the camcorder in that amount of time.

My husband was getting ready to go to bed when he yelled at me to look at all of the airplanes flying by.  When I went in to look at the planes, facing the north, I glanced through the window that faces west.  There was an odd shaped bright light.  When it started bobbing around, I got my videw camera and started taking pictures.  It danced around, disappeared, came back, and came so close the first time that I got a stunning look at it.  It was round, except at the very bottom, it looked flat.  It had two lines through the middle, a round circle in the center of the paralell lines, and an emblem in the middle of the circle.  There were designs on the top and bottom parts.  I viewed this for about 5 seconds, then it gradually moved away and across the trees, then into a bright ball again, going further away.  It had a dark side and a bright side.  When it was bright, there would be a jagged streak of light moving upward, dimming the bottom part as it went.  After it dimmed, it would then get smaller.  It bobbed around, disaappeared and did all sorts of things for several minutes.  Then the dark side got very close and was very large.  It had the same markings on that side as the bright side.  There were red, yellow and orange lights that I could not figure out.  It came very close 3 times before it finally disappeared.  I have great movies of this.  What do I do with them.  I would love for someone to see them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHello Peter,\n\r\nHere's an update on your 2/10/01; 21:00 Tell City, Indiana Case (Posted 2/18/01).  It has been determined (through a comparison test with similar video equipment) that most of the 75 minute video was the planet Venus taken at the  'infinity' setting.  The flat bottom and strange markings are present in all of the test videos taken so far (camera glitch?).  No explanation has been found for the moving light group also included in the same video.\n\r\nBest.........Jerry\n\r\nPS: Looking forward on hearing from you about the recent Indiana sightings from Evansville, Danville, Columbia City and New Albany that were posted to your site\n\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nJerry L.

The back window of our car had busted out previously, and it was snowing outside, and we all had our coats on with hoods up because it was so cold. I was talking to my older son, and suddenly my middle son yelled out \"Mama!\" and interrupted me. I looked in the rearview mirror to see what he wanted that was so important as to interrupt me, and all of my children were looking up through the empty back window, with shock on their faces. I looked up through the front window, and as close to us, as if it were only three stories above, sat a Hugh dark, saucer shaped, solid object. It had no sound what so ever, and hovered or sat in the sky right above us. I stopped the car, and we all got out. This saucer like object had beautiful flowing lights all around the mid section of it, and was as big as a base ball diamond. We were on Beltline Rd, near the Naval Air Station. We stood there for a few moment! s, and suddenly the craft shot off in the direction of Arlington from us to the right. It went so fast, and made no sound, that I have never seen even a jet move so fast. I called the police station when we got home to report it, and the officer said they had no reports of any sightings, and that I could call the Naval Air Station and inquire. I called the Navy Base, and the person on the phone assured me that they had no reports of any thing like we had witnessed. It has been many years sense that day, but none of us have ever forgotten it, and it burns in my memory as if it were today. I was NOT a believer in such things before this day, but am now! I saw what I saw, and no one can ever take that from me. We didn't talk about it to too many people because back then, no one would have listened, even the police officer laughed at me. I have been in the US Navy myself and know the Need to Know is keep from the public from our government. If anyone is really listening, or cares, we are NOT ALONE!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is estimated by us.  It is unknown.  PD",

Dad was driving, mom was laying down snoozing in the back seat of the car.  I was in the right front passenger seat. We were going up a hill and off to our left suddenly a large light came on and lit up the hill and the inside of our car.  Dad pulled over and stopped the car and told mom to get up.  The light went out.  There was no sound, nothing then the light came back on again and off again and I guess took off. This thing was round and was roughly as big as our car.  The light it emitted was rather like looking at a brilliant silver dollar, it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  We could make out no distinct features and it made no sound.  The area we were in is the Peace River Valley and the bank at that location falls away steeply about 600-700'.  The evening was dark, no light, no snow on the ground but there were a few large lazy flakes falling.  My dad went to the RCMP and asked if they had \"heard of a helicopter in trouble or anything\" no they hadn't and dad never persued it.  My dad and mom owned their own business at the time and were very reliable people and wished to remain that way so we never talked outside the family about it but privately we thought it was a UFO not from this world and that they were here checking the mega project that was underway at that time (the W.A.C. Bennett Dam Project) where before there had been nothing but a few farms in this remote area of British Columbia, Canada.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

You must understand that this is a very small community nestled in the hills with no airports within 20 miles. While on my deck watching this event my next door neighbor came running out...this copter was SO LOW and so LOUD that the house was shaking...and asked me what was happening...at least 2 children were in the doorway watching...we exchanged a couple of words on the matter and he asked me what I thought it was and I told him \"I dont want to say\" as I glanced at the children. From the perspective of the movies the helicopter sounded large and POWERFUL...like a 'huey'...the only light on the copter was a single small red light...I'm not sure of the location on the copter because my attention was fully focused on the orange light which by then had moved completely out of sight.

It was very dark and I was facing north-northwest, admiring the Milkyway galaxy.  \n\r\nSuddenly the whole earth lit up.  The trees in front of me were bright green.  My natural instinct was to search for the source of the light.  It was coming from over my right  shoulder.  I turned to my right and saw a brownish trail or streak.  The huge bluish white brilliant light was about the size of a full moon.  Instantly, the light went behind some spotty clouds.  (There were gaps between the little clouds.)  Then spikes of radiation flashed off of the bluish white ball.  The spikes spanned from horizon to horizon.  The ball disappeared and the sky and the earth fell dark.  I was stunned remembering the magnitude of the spikes that shot from east to west then fell downward like an umbrella, or like cat's claws.  They were curved.  \n\r\nI am an audiovisual  engineer and electronics technician.  Sound is my profession.  I waited for at least 10 minitues for a sonic boom or some atmospheric disturbance,but nothing happened,  It was silent.  I heard crickets and there was some kind of night bird churping away.  The sound of the night seemed to magnify!  Trying to comprehend the speed and time that this all took place left me in a state of shock for several days.  It must have taken place outside of our atmosphere because there was no sonic boom, etc.  This dramatically multiplies the distance covered in a few split seconds.\n\n\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>For video footage of the event, captured by the Sandia National Laboratory sky camera in Albuquerque, please see the following URL:  \n\r\nhttp://www.cs.sandia.gov/SEL/apps/energy/meteor.htm  \n\r\nPD))",

We were the only ones on the road and then another car started to come down the road and it flew behind the trees and stopped.  We didn't see it after that.\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>No date is indicated for the event.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date for the night before the report was written.

I had my wife come out to see it.  In the scope at full power it still looked like a blood red star. I watched it for a few min and it took on a slight greenish color at the top but stayed mostly blood red. It moved side to side just a bit and got smaller. I was left with the impression that it was moving away to the north west. It reminded me of the way the space shuttle looks when they have a night launch and it is moving away and all you can see is the engine burning as it fades away in the distance. My wife thought it looked like a kite moving side to side. I told her that it could not be a kite because there is no wind.  We watched it till it got so small it was getting hard to see it.

We were traveliing state route 261 west, as we crested the top of a hill and I notice a triangular shape hovering over several houses.  At first thought it was a tower because of the light configuration and the height off the ground, approx 300 ft. high. Then my wife asked if I seen the lights.  She said, \"I didn't know they put a tower up there.\"  I responed by saying there is no tower there, only houses.  As we got closer,  We could clearly see the triagle shape.  My wife looked to the north and notice a similar light configuation not to far away hovering.  I then looked the the south, I noticed the same thing to the south.  With out thinking, we came up to the road near to the lights, I turned down the road to get a better look.  We came about 500 ft from the object and could clearly see the object was grey and had three red lights on the corners with a white light in the middle.  It was completly silent.  When we got closer and object slowly moved to the east.  My wife noticed the other object to the north moved in a paralle line to the large object.  Then the radio went out.  As we went around the circle at the end of the road, the object began slowly moving west.  We past under the object.  My wife said we should go staight home.  We were only several min. from home.

The most amazing thing about the whole sighting was when my brother inlaw shinned a high power flashlight at it. It shinned a VERY bright white light back at us!

We were on the I-5 going south and we realized we had gone to far south of Fresno (where I live) when we hit the 198 going east/west.  Realizing our mistake we got on 198 heading east towards Hanford with the intention of transferring to the 99 Northbound in Hanford and heading back up to Fresno.  However, about halfway there (not far from the Lemoore Airbase, I found out) I saw something out the window that made me do a double take. I saw several pale 'twinkle' lights like those seen on airplanes and helicopters, however they were all white (no red or blue or green) and there were several beams of pale light moving across the ground.  My very first impression was that there were 3 helicopters flying in very tight formation using spotlights to look for something....  my next thought was that maybe it was a crop duster or something doing some sort of night job... but after a few seconds I realized that neither of these were correct.... I pointed it out to  my friend (who was driving) as it was out his window (to the north) and I think maybe less than 100 feet off the ground... and it seemed to be moving very slowly and gracefully.... it then arced upward and turned back towards the freeway (coming south) that we were on and as it passed overhead I managed to see a really faint silhouette against the black night sky... I could barely make out an airplane shape with very long thin wings and large, ellipsoid shaped bulbs at the tips of both wings... and as it flew overhead there was absolutely no sound whatsoever...  it then performed a very graceful but tight turn and flew back over the freeway again (this time heading north) and as it flew over the field to our left I saw again 3 faint, silvery nimbus's of light (almost like searchlights) coming from what looked like the underside of the nose and the 2 ellipsoid shapes at the tip of the wings, and the light app! ared to be sweeping back and forth over the ground.  At this point I was really excited because I had never seen anything like it before. My friend told me to dig the camera out from the backseat and try and take pictures of it... so I dug around in the back really quickly and by the time I got it ready, the object had once again flown over us and was pacing us to the right (south of 198 heading east in the same direction as us) maybe a quarter of a mile out and a hundred or so feet off the ground...  I then attempted to take several pictures... but as the craft was completely dark and there was no real light reflections the only thing I could see were its steady blinking lights... So I tried to time it as best I could to try and capture a picture when the lights were actually on instead of off, but as I write this I don't know how they've turned out...  However I'm pretty sure its not a UFO but some sort of secret plane from the Lemoore Airbase... and I was wondering if I draw a picture of what I think I saw, do you know someone who might be able to tell me what I saw based upon its outline and its behavior...??  My friend thinks it was maybe an A-10 Tank-killer, because what he saw differs from what I saw by a little... however, I don't think this is correct because of the 3 lights and the fact that it made no sound at all... So anyhow, I am trying to find out if the plane is something common or if it is might be one of the top secret ones that you hear about (like the aurora)...\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have corresponded with this witness.  He seems to have ruled out most possible explanations for the sighting, and he apparently will speak with personnel from Lemoore Air Base in the near future.  PD",

I live out in the country were there are a lot of rice farms and it is usually very dark. These lights look very similar to the light reflected from planets, yet they turn on and off and move.  This event:  There were two bright lights, approx. eye level to myself 5'-10\", one on top of the other with an outstreched hands thumb space between.  The bottom lights path then rotated clockwise till they were side by side.  At this point we noticed that the space between them was decreasing as the lights appeared to merged.  We noticed three more of these lights just south of these that stayed stationary while the others moved.  This was a steady motion that took around 2 - 3 min. When the moving light merged, the others went out.  This is a fairly common event seen from my home and witnessed by atleast 13 people that I know of.  I have also notice an extreme increase in air traffic at night.  I am a police officer and have talked with some of the sheriff's deputys that work in that part of the county but none offered any info.

They were there for about 5 more minutes before both of them started moving together very slow toward the South. 5 minutes later about 45 degress above the horizon looking south toward the objects 1 started to move toward the West and 1 continued on South a few more minutes and then started heading directly South. We observed the South bound object for 25 more minutes before it was not visable to the naked eye any longer.  The West bound object started to get obscurred by the bright sunshine and was never seen again that we could see after about 3 minutes it headed toward the West. Visability was cear and unlimited and not a breeze of wind to be felt. I did take a look at the objects with magnified eye pieces and thought i would clearly see a high alltitude weather balloon but thiis was not the case.

Last year in Darwin many people also saw them. Strangely enough it was at a time when the US military was staging a joint war games exercise - Pitch Black which occurs every year across the Top End of the Northern Territory. One incident was a firework display ona city beach the objects were observed by hundreds of people and hardly even commented on. They travelled slowly across the night sky, formed a triangle and then some manouvres then disappeared. They were also seen by my sister and many other people that we spoke to. Each time the behaviour was similar. The glowing golden objects travelled ina perfectly spaced file across the sky out over the sea. They would then manouver into traiangles and other shapes and then either disapear or rocket off at a great speed. On the local radio a man confessed to having released hundreds of orange garbage bag fire powered devices off at various localities. What a psycho - he must have spent a fortune and to what avail? I myself saw on separate occasions, examples of both types of objects. The pyro devices were erratic in behaviour and it was quite obvious to any viewer as to what they were as they flickered and drifted rising and falling. I saw the latter objects on the night of the lunar eclipse. The other orbs travelled in lines straight and at a constant speed not in any erratic fashion at all. We all think that the orbs were some kind of military test. The amazing thing was how blase people were about them. \"Oh UFOS maybe?\" Just thought you might be interested.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate; we have arbitrarily assigned a date.

There is, however a small town called \r\nMoravian Falls, and it is approximately 25 miles north of Hickory, where I \r\nlive.  \n\r\nI don't know if anyone with your organization has followed up on the report.  \r\nI tend to agree with your comment that if a UFO had crashed there, it is \r\nlikely that there would have been other reports at that time.  However, since \r\nI do live near the area and had occasion to drive out to the site in question \r\nlast Thursday (3/1/01), I made a point to look around to see if there was \r\nanything unusual.  (Granted, this was nearly 3 weeks after the sighting was \r\nreported.)  I did not see any signs of a crash at all.  In fact, the \r\nconstruction site mentioned in the report is about ten feet or less from a \r\nwell-travelled highway, so I believe it would be difficult for something like \r\nthat to go unnoticed in a town of that size.\n\r\nRegards,\r\n((name and e-address deleted))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>No other reports from Morvain Falls, NC.

All the girls except one stayed out with me, it got too cold for the rest so they retreated to the family room.  All I remeber was talking about all the stars, and how we are ants in an aquarian for others to watch. We decided to go into the house and get a drink. My companion and I looked out the window and spotted the savirical ship, it was gray metallinc in color, with a set of circular cube lights on top. The squares on the top were large and one blinked on and then the next. They were multiple colors. It gave the ship the appearence that it was spinning, but it was not. One light would go on and then the next in a sequence around the ship.  My friend and I went out on the porch to look at it.  I was amazed at how large it was.  I would have to guess about 3 football fields. Some of the other girls looked but freaked when they say it.  I stood on the porch and watched, when suddenly an extremely intense blue white light came from the center, bottom of the ship and hit the ground.  We all became frighted after that and hid in the house.  We told parents the next day, but no one believed us, we were only 14 at the time. We did report it to the airforce, and police, but no response.  The part that scared me the most was the small spheres of light that came to my window two summers after I had seen the UFO.  I knew they wanted me to come out, but I was so scarred I hid.  I have since ran into people that have similar experiences, especially the glowing balls outside there window that seem to becon one to come with it..I also remember knowing somehow that this ship was a minning ship and that it was minning quaritze crystals.  I remember telling my mom to buy all the quaritze she could find because it would be very valuable some day.  I also remember that there may have been missing time envoled, but I have never found anyone that could do regressive hypnosysis.  I would like to try again, and see the most fantastic thing I have ever seen! .  It tr uly changed by life.  Thank you for you time, ((name deleted))\u2026",

We didn't believe her, but we rushed outside to see what was up anyway.  When we got outside we saw an enormous glowing oval-shaped object hovering in the sky to the south.  The object was about a quarter of a mile away and about 300 feet off of the ground.  It was a bright flourescent pale, pale greenish silver.  I perceived a domed top, and a row of different colored lights running horizontally across it.  It had a white light on the bottom of it.  It was hanging very low above the field, and then it slowly moved west behind a hill.  We ran and got our quad-runner out of the barn and raced up to the top of the hill along the power road to see if we could get another look at it, but there was nothing up there.  Our neighbor suggested that it might be a blimp, but it looked nothing like a blimp, it was much too large, and there was no good explanation as to why a blimp would be flying so low through the canyon at night in the dark.  We called the Redlands PD to see if anyone else had reported anything unusual, but we told no.  We've been trying to get through to March ARB which is near our home, but their line has been busy.",

It was more as if the craft itself emitted the glow.  They zoomed southward across the sky, encircling each other, then zoomed  away further into the east.  They were not so much a color as they were a light.  But if there is any color they'd be, i'd say a silver, blueish color.  i can't say for sure how big they were, seeing as they were far away.  Definately bigger than any car or bus, though, i'd say.  And maybe it was because i was so fixated on them, but for some reason, when i saw them, the cold air seemed to dissappear.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Electrical or magnetic effectsSummary of San Antonio MUFON investigator trainee's Von Ormy, Texas UFO investigation\n\n\n\r\nJudy Moore and I went  to interview a family living on a farm near Von Ormy, Texas  that had an encounter with a U.F.O. one night about a month ago.  . . .  We interviewed the mother, a computer programmer in San Antonio, and her children, filling out MUFON forms and having them draw what they remembered seeing.  We also took photos of the area, and walked all around the area.  . . .  The sighting occurred around 9:30 p.m., or so, with the object first seen hovering over a large field in front of the farm house, shining lights down on the field (the field had cattle in it when we looked at it and is subleased to another family) when one of the children saw it, and with lights off but clearly visible when the mother was alerted.  It came toward the house 50 - 100 feet above the ground, coming toward one of the children (13-year-old daughter] outside, who ran, quite frightened, inside the house.  (When last seen by one of them, it was quite close to one side of the house.)  The mother ran for a gun, dogs, cats and nearby coyotes were making a lot of noise and reacting, and then the object disappeared.  When they were outside the house, with the object nearby, they felt a lot of heat. They speculated later that they may have been exposed to radiation, since they all developed colds just after the incident  , possibly because their immune systems had been affected.  (Or, this could have just been a coincidence.)  Later, in the middle of the night, a radio and TV (that have remote controls) came on further frightening them.  . . .  There were some indications that they may've been abducted.  [She and the daughter examined themselves for possible surgical implants, tissue removal, etc., and all she noticed was something like a mosquito bite behind one ear, that would'nt go away.]  She said she had had two \"false pregnancies\" when I asked if she'd ever had any. The woman said she'd meet with a local abductee support group, and is interested in being hypnotically regressed to see if anything can be remembered that  is perhaps being blocked from conscious memory.  . . .  Hearing all their stories separately, it sounded convincing that something unusual had occurred.  . . .  The craft had made no sound other than, perhaps, a low humming sound, that the mother thought she might've heard.  . . .  They called 911,  sheriff's deputies came, and deputies continue to check on them almost every night. The woman's husband's response puzzles me a bit, as well as the fact that she had made little mention of him when she first told us about the incidence.  He had not been at the house when the incidence occurred.  The woman said he had been supportive when I asked how he fit in.  While we were there he was working outside, came in later, we were introduced to him, and he went to sleep on the sofa by the TV.  . . .  Personally I am a bit puzzled as to why he didn't share at least a little of his excitement, puzzlement, amusement, etc. at what his wife   and the children were reporting.  . . .  Ron Johnson, in Austin, told me on the MUFON amateur radio net this morning that he had run into similar responses from spouses before and that the husband's response should be mentioned in the report.  He encouraged making efforts to document the false pregnancies.  Also, he wanted me to remind MUFON members to watch Dateline at 9 p.m. Tuesday, when Dr. John Mach will be interviewed. - Cliff Gieseke, May 21, '94 (From notes I made in 1994; I am no longer a member of MUFON; when I tried to report the incident to the Air Force at Lackland, they told me, to my amusement, to report it to the sheriff's department, which apparently now has the responsibility of protecting our air space -- Cliff Gieseke, San Antonio, TX)<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Our gratitude to San Antonio MUFON's Cliff Gieseke for submitting this report.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectVery slow-moving, silent, triangular formation of lights; some RF interference\n\r\nI was driving US Route 30 East from Forest Hills (just outside Pittsburgh) to Irwin.  This is the usual route I take home from work.  My wife was in the car but was dozing and laying down.  As I came over the hill near Norwin High School I saw a light in the eastern sky - nothing unusual at first.  As I approached the intersection of 10th Street (Irwin) and Rt. 30, I noted that it was getting very much brighter (white) and was slowly \"pulsing\" in brightness - about one second from bright to dim and one second back again.  When I got closer, perhaps 1/2 mile from directly underneath it, I could see that it had two close-set front lights like headlights, both white, which no longer appeared to be pulsing.  It also had a red light on its port \"wingtip\" (relative position of the lights implied \"wingtip\", but I could see no silhouette, only the lights), so I concluded it was a plane. It was moving to the west very slowly, though.  When I got closer still I could see the starboard \"wingtip\" light which was also red.  This struck me as a bit odd.  It was passing nearly directly overhead at this point.  My car's digital clock read 6:48 PM.  I was listening to a Pittsburgh  station (1410 KQV-AM) which breaks up and fades back in a lot in Irwin, but the static is typically just white-noise.  As the object passed overhead, the signal was lost in a wave of loud \"angry\" buzzing, which caused me to shut the radio off.  The car was not otherwise affected. The object was moving west very slowly indeed at this point.  Since neither size nor distance were known I'll put this in terms of objects at arm's length.  Its length was about 1/2 the width of a normal music CD at arm's length, and it was moving (when directly overhead) about 1 CD-diameter in about 7 seconds. Since it was moving in the opposite direction to me, I thought this was unusually slow for a non-hovering aircraft, so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear it (thinking perhaps it was a helicopter and the \"wingtip\" effect of the red lights was an illusion).  I could hear absolutely nothing but the other cars - no \"airliner roar\", no chopper blades, nothing. I should note that I work near several hospitals in Pittsburgh.  If a helicopter is sufficiently low to appear that large (and they often are), I can easily hear it going overhead, even over the roar of a busy Pittsburgh street and my car's engine with the windows rolled up. So between the red (not green) starboard lights, the radio interference (which was gone after I passed about 1/2 mile \"behind\" the object), the slow motion, and the silence, I'm very confused.  Again, all I could see was two white \"headlights\", closely set, with two red lights at \"wingtip\" positions.  I guess you could call it a \"triangle\", but again I emphasise I saw no silhouette, only the lights themselves. It may have been a perfectly conventional craft, but it was nothing I'm familiar with.",

It stayed in one place for a very long time and then simply vanished.\n\r\nAt approximately 21:00 hrs. I saw a round object that I at first thought was an unusually big and bright star. I was driving at the time, so I was not sure if it was moving or not. I sopped about two miles from my house to look at it. It did not move. It was over my left shoulder. It was fairly high in the sky, but looked big. At times it seemed as if a halo was around it. I continued home and when I got there the \"star\"was over my right shoulder. (I'm not sure whether it moved or not while I was driving. It seemed to, but who can be sure when they are moving themselves?)I got out of my car and watched it for a while. It stayed in the exact same spot. I had my neighbors outside light (1/8 mi. down the road if that) and trees as a reference point. I finally went in and ate. I went back out to check on the star. It was still there in the same spot. I hadn't called anyone nearby, I was afraid I'd look stupid. There was a whole lot of activity in the air, which is unusual where I live. I'm way out in the country. None of the aircraft approached the object that I could tell. I went back in and picked up my camera, not really thinking I could get a decent picture but I might be able to get a better look at it through my 300mm lens. It was gone. But there were other strange things happening. Across the road, I could see lights moving through the trees. The lights were fairly big so I could not justify what I was seeing with my own eyes. they were kind off light pinkish orange. This is the best I can describe them. This continued for another 1/2 hour or so at random. When the big \"star\" had left, the air traffic had also calmed down. This star was big and I don't understand my hesitation in calling for a witness. I didn't call anybody until it was all over. Ther's one thing I left out and it might seem crazy, but I got really sleepy at one point and went in to lay down. I fell asleep, but it wasn't long. the dog was barking like crazy and my cell phone was ringing,so I woke up. That's when I grabbed my camera ! and went outside. Like I said it was gone. I looked all around the sky to see if had moved with the rest of the stars. It simply was not there. That's why I am convinced I saw something unusual. I called my local airport, they were of no help. I also called the county communications department, they didn't know anything. I called several other places to no avail. I called the Richmond Air port this morning and they referred me to your number.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with the wintess, and she seemed serious and credible to us.  However, we suspect she may have been looking at Venus.  We have no explanation for the lights that were apparently seen moving through the trees.  PD",

There were no sounds, but the object(s) had to either be extremely large or close to the earth, as they were much larger than the running lights of several airplanes that were overhead at different altitudes around the same time. I thought at first it could be the space station or shuttle, or, maybe a sattelite, but realized it was travelling East to West.

Searching the sky I could see the tiny, sporadic contrails which are often emitted during these daily flights.  Then I noticed a white light in a stationary position in the Northeast.  It was in the general area of where the jet had been training but it did not move for several minutes.  I had to take my eyes away for a few moments to attend to something.  When I searched the sky again, I saw that the object was now perched much nearer and appeared to have some solidity to it, though it mostly appeared as a reflective type of light.  It did look bigger and was in a more overhead location.  I positioned myself just under some telephone wires so I could better gauge any movement of the light.  It either remained very stationary, or would drift in irregular movements from time to time.  I watched it come into what appeared to be a nearer location- more overhead.  Its appearance of some kind of hard object grew more apparent.  I could almost determine the object to have a slight cylindrical, or oblong shape.  The jets that had been present earlier faded with their sound into the distance.  Just as the object was nearing a directly overhead position, I went to see if I could find my friend M who was outside somewhere nearby.  I did find him and we proceeded to both observe the object hold still, then drift, now apparently away from us.  Soon, I left M to watch and I went to find a pair of binoculars.  My son helped me look but we were unsuccessful.  Then my son and I joined M in observing the object for several more minutes as it alternated between moments of stillness and movement.  As it continued in a southerly direction, it appeared to either glow brighter with its own light or reflect more off of the sun.  This continued until it faded in the southern distance.  This daytime sighting comes after 2 nightime sightings of similar events at night 3 and 2 nights before- which were not reported here.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a helium balloon.

It was about 8PM when I noticed a Bright light flickering in the distance out of my bedroom window to the Northwest.  I called my family into the room to take a look.  We watched it for a few minutes to try to figure out what it might be.  It certainly had no characteristics of an airplane or helicopter.  It remained pretty stationary for the few moments we watched, then I decided to get the video camera.  On the closeups the bright white flickering light became what appeared as a spiraling fireball with it still white in the center with two dots in the center and a bluish green tint around the perimeter.  As I was video taping my son noticed a second light identical to the first to the south of the first. Moments later as I turned my attention to the second light, there was a third to appear, right in the center of the first two.  All appeared to be at different altitudes. But all three lights had the same overall appearance from a distance, and all three lights are exactly the same shape on the closeups, and all have the exact same characteristics. The strangest thing is that the sky was very busy with aircraft flying across the lighted objects from south to north, as the 3 objects were in the west northwest sky.  When the lights disappeared the sky became quiet with not an aircraft in site for over 20 minutes.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to us quite serious minded in his description of the event.

We arrived at an observation point that included a small parking lot and a roofed scenic looking area.  It oversaw Canyon Lake and its surrounding mountains.  We all proceeded to leave the vehicle and stepped out to the railing that protected one from a fall down the observation point's steep rocky terrain.  It was a very clear night with no wind.  It was warm enough where you would not need a jacket.  We then began looking towards the horizon line above the mountains where we noticed a formation of lights that encircled the canyon area.  Some of them were actually inside of the canyon.  We didn't say much at first because they were about a 1/2 mile to a mile away and shape and dimension were lost especially at night time.  We then pointed them out to each other speculating as to the nature of these lights.  Helicopters?  Airplanes?  There is after all an airport due west in Phoenix about 30-50 miles away.  We slowly began to realize that these UFOs were not moving in any conventional manner. we counted from between 10 to 12 of these objects.  And they began moving in a westerly direction right towards us.  The closer they got the more detail we could interpret.  Some of the craft appeared to be \"scanning\" the ground below with a white light beam and thats when we realized exactly what we were looking at.  There appeared to be about 10-11 \"disc/saucer\" type craft and one or two \"flagship\" type craft.  One ship appeared to our right and we could make out its very large size and the fact that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.  This was one of the flagship type.  It was large, football field size, octogonal with a series of lights (white, blue and red) that went at differing patterns on the bottom and sides of the ship.  The craft underneath was whitish/tanish and the foreward area was very dark and shaped like a \"boomerang\".  (My speculation is that it protects the ship through high radiation activities and is! dark be cause it is thick lead plating.)  It had several compartments underneath and a \"command\" area of some sort.  It had no markings of insignias.  It moved 20-35 MPH and soon disappeared behind some mountains.  We became shocked into a half fear half awe state.  Another ship may have noticed this and came up from behind a \"Prudential\" looking mountain and emitted a blue light beam at us.  It then generated a great wind or force of some sort that coupled with the blue light had a very calming effect on us.  It seemed to energize us and we could feel our \"chi-energy\" accelerate.  We began doing \"tai-chi\" type physical movements while they seemed to communicate with us telepathically.  The images and messages to seemed to be sharing with us we later verified the same experiences.  It then stopped after about perhaps 5-10 minutes.  Then another ship that appeared to be \"scanning\" to the left of us stopped its strobing light beam, elevated and turned towards us very deliberately.  It began moving at us and we proceeded to reenter our car.  It slowly came right over our car.  We rolled down our windows and studied it while it went past.  This description matches the flagship from above.  Definitely octogonal with a series of lights and ducts or compartment passageways evident underneath with a \"command\" center complete with \"boomerang\" shaped forward area.  And again it made absolutely no sound. Somesort of anti-gravity drive to be sure.  Our car was not on and we had no other electronical devices so performance interference was not monitored.  It then went behind us and disappeared behind some mountains in the east.  The other remaining craft all slowly disappeared before sunrise.  We explored the areas that we could access and found no traces of their visit.  Perhaps they were searching for a mineral or have a base nearby.  Maybe they were sightseeing. We KNOW they were NOT any terrestrial technologies responsible for these ships. We returned every weekend after and experienced many more UFO encounters but have ! never th ought to bring a camera and two of us no longer live in the area.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Report seems to be serious-minded.

As usual, I scanned the sky for lights, and saw the usual assortment of recognizable aircraft lights.  However, at my 1:00 position (approx. NW), I saw a group of three very white bright lights in a straight line, close enough to each other that my initial reaction was that they couldn't be separate aircraft.  They were also much lower than aircraft in the area typically fly.  As I continued west, I tried to gauge the object's motion relative to mine.  While I initially thought the object was travelling east, opposite me, it began a banking manouver which carried it perpendicularly across the highway directly in front of me, approximately 1/4 mile away, and only a couple of hundred feet up at most.  Though it was night, there was more than enough ambient lighting from the surrounding area, so as the object crossed my path while banked to it's right side I could see it's bottom, which was a black diamond shape, with three bright white lights across it.  There were no discernable wings - it was as though I was looking at a large, black kite.  Two of the lights were at opposite points of the diamond, with the third in the middle.  Since the object was banked over, the three lights were in a vertical line.  The object continued it's turn, then levelled out at treetop height and continued westbound towards the Hudson River, paralleling the highway but on the other side from me.  My exit came up and I pulled off, then watched until the object left my field of view. When I first observed the craft, I called my girlfriend at home (appox. 2 miles from my position) intending to ask her to go outside and look for the object.  When she answered I didn't have a chance to ask, as right away she started telling me that she was watching an object from the house.  We agreed that it was the same craft, and she was able to view it for a minute or two after it left my view.  She had initially noticed it through the living room window, due to it's bright, unusually configured lights and low altitude. Though I've always believed that our planet is (and has been throughout history) visited by extraterrestrials, I've never witnessed anything like this myself.  This area of the Hudson Valley is known for many sightings, particularly during the early 1980's.  Having spent five years in the Air Force with a keen interest and familiarity with most types of aircraft, I know that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft.  This was not an instance of ambigous/anomalous lights in the sky.  I saw a distinct shape to the object.  Furthermore, it's flight characteristics were unusual.  Not in the sense of speed or extreme manouverability, but more regarding it's flight path.  Even if, for arguements sake, it was a military aircraft of unconventional design (Stewart AFB is nearby), I can't understand why it would fly so low as it crossed over a heavily travelled interstate highway, then descend to treetop level and parallel the road... As soon as I got home I continued to search the sky for another glimpse, and turned on the scanners, all in vain.  The morning paper didn't carry any stories about it, but hopefully others saw it and will report their sighting(s).  Tonight I plan to call the tower at Stewart and ask if they received any reports or tracked anything themselves.",

It was the period just before it gets dark and my brother said look at this! I looked up and saw what looked like normal spotlights, there were 5 in a horizontal line. I thought nothing of it. I went back to fishing. He said hey look at this thing! I looked again, and now the lights were changing form- they went from a line to a 7 shape, to an L shape then to a cross type shape. I then began to pay attention to this. We couldnt see anything else at this point. The lights were above the treeline approx. 300 yards away.  It was a clear night, stars out, moon shining. All of a sudden, there was no sky above us. It was black. We could both feel what we can only describe as the field that exists between opposing magnets. It was weird. The craft then turned and some sky became visible again and at that point we could see the shape of this thing. It was like a 55 gallon drum that was cut lenghtwise and laid flat. This thing was huge. Like a city block huge. It made no noise, and aside from the \"spotlights\" we saw initially, it had no lights. We were scared beyond words. This thing was directly above our heads for what seemed like forever. It eventually just moved up and away at a very slow rate of speed and ascent. We left immediately after that, when we got home we told our family about it and called the Redding police to see if anyone else had seen or reported this. We declined to leave our names because we did not want to be associated with this in any way. Take this for what its worth- both of us saw what we saw, and to this day, I cannot stop looking at the sky. I am compelled to looking upward all the time. That image will stay with me until I pass. It was extremely frightening and definitely not of this world whatever it was.",

It was approximately 500 feet above the truck stop. It was a bright white light that had a haze to it. On channel 19, the truckers were speaking many profanities because they couldn't understand what it was. The object laid above us for approximately 5 minutes although it felt like a half hour, I don't remember looking at my clock to see how long it was actually there for. Channel 19 went wild with hysteria and confusion. The light made absolutely no noise whatsoever it was so quiet it was scary. I don't remember hearing the engine of the truck roaring. At the same moment the light disappeared, the lights in the truck stop went out as did the electronic equipment and all Semis and vehicles in the parking lot. This happened in a blink of an eye, approximately five seconds and it was gone. We all were dumbfounded. After the incident, we all looked up to the sky and noticed many helicopters around the area. Not many people talked about it though afterwards, which I thought was weird. I've always wanted to report this incident but didn't know who to talk to.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nExit 4, truck stop in Hudson, Wisconsin UFO spotted.\n\r\nAt Exit 4 Truck Stop, I was working as a waitress, and was out in a friend's truck, and a luminous bright light filled the sky, covered the entire truck stop and illuminated the whole area of the truck stop so we don't know what shape it was. It had absolutely no sound whatsoever. I heard truckers on channel 19 on the CB saying things like \"What the *** is that?\", \"Sh**, I know I haven't drank tonight, please someone tell me what the *** that thing is\", \"that is no *** airplane\", etc...channel 19 was running like a mad house with profanity. the lights went out at the truck stop at the same time it disappeared, and the trucks, all the trucks lost power too, all electronic equipment was shut off for approximately 5-10 seconds while the \"craft\" disappeared\"...the craft just shut off it's light the way it looked, but it was gone.

We saw what looked like 3 round large balls of light levetating in the air.The biggest one was on top,it looked like it was very hot in color, a very bright white, the next one was under that one and it looked like the color of fire yellow, then the next one was under that one, it looked like it was fire red/yellow. All three were equally spaced apart what looked like about 30 to 60 feet apart. The biggest one looked to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter, the next one down was about 35 to 25 feet in diameter, and the small one was the closest one to the ground, it looked to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was about 60 feet off the ground. They all just hung in the air with no sound, but very bright.As I drove faster to get closer to them, I got about 200 ft from them and they all just disappeared. As we drove further, we seen what looked like a very large white oval light ahead of us maybe 1/4 mile. I then stoped the car, turned off the car lights, and shut off the car as not to disturb whatever it was.My friend and I watched it for about 5 min. then it started to move very slow but started to go faster and started to pickup speed. Then it took off real fast and left a long trail behind that looked like the same shape and it stayed white for some time. It looked like what your hand would look like as you passed it in front of you fast.We drove to Watson Lake and reported it to the R.C.M.P. as a UFO sighting. My friend is a Pentecostal Minister for 20 years, he is about 54 years old, and I am 52 years old myself now.

It is hard to beleive that was over 10 years ago.  Where has all the time gone? \n\r\nI still don't know what it could have been.  It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn't want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?  And again, maybe we will.  Anyway, it is something we can tell our grand kid's about.\n\r\n((paragraph deleted))\n\r\n((END CORRESPONDENCE))\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

LOCATION: Charlotte County (northern southwest Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico). EVENT: I was outside my home, returning from my mailbox and spotted a contrail in progress above my location. There were other contrails in the sky nearer the horizon, some criss-crossing. With the unaided eye, the size of the contrail was about half the width of a pencil at arm's length, with an elongated object about half the size of a pencil tip traveling in front of it. What was unusual was that the object was displaying a single reddish-orange glow or light along its length. I rushed and got a pair of binoculars and observed that the object appeared to be a conventional looking passenger or cargo jet, except for one big difference: its fuselage, at least the underside portion observable to me on the ground, was glowing or radiating a uniform bright reddish-orange color (not a point of light, but the entire length of the fuselage). The wings were normal in appearance, not glowing or lighted, and appeared, from the great distance, to be white, tan, or gray. Two contrails were forming a short distance behind the aircraft, which then combined into a single contrail (a normal occurrence). The aircraft was traveling southward along the Gulf Coast of Florida, yet slightly inland. The nearest international airport it could have flown out of is in Sarasota, and then north of that, in Tampa, where there is also a major headquarters-status  U.S. Air Force base (the Gulf War was managed from there). Since the sun was still above the treetops and there was no evidence of any sunset activity in the sky (even if there was, the aircraft would have needed a mirrored  fuselage to reflect the level of light seen), I lowered my binoculars and rushed inside the open side door to my garage to get a video camera I keep on a shelf and back outside. I timed it after the event and my eyes were off the aircraft only 8 seconds. When I looked back up in the sky, all I saw was the contrail cut off in its tracks where I had seen it last and no aircraft. I searched with my binoculars and couldn't locate any evidence of it, which should have still been visible. I wish now I had kept observing the jet with the binoculars for those 8 seconds. Was what I saw an exotic new U.S. stealth aircraft fitted with a skin of light panels that could allow it to blend into the sky upon activation, or is there a conventional explanation? I don't know.  All I can do is report what I observed. I've witnessed one other definitely exotic stealth aircraft earlier in my life, totally different than this incident, but some things need and deserve continued secrecy.",

About the same brightness as a 25 watt lightbulb.  I knew this wasn't an airplane because My mother works at an airport and i've seen all kinds of lights. Each individual light was in a diamond or oval shape. They blinked at at 4 second increments for 5 minutes, then they dissappeared.  To this day, I still belive it was a UFO.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectSometime during an August sunday afternoon, I spotted an object at the intersection of Rt. 684 and I84 at  Brewster, NY. This occurred in (I believe in 1975). I should add that the sky was perfectly clear. The object in question was in a stationary position above a stand of pine trees at the intersection of the two main traffic arteries. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 yards above the tops of the pines. As I noticed something in the air in close proximity , I thought to myself,  \"That's  just an airplane - Danbury Airport is just up the road\". Turning towards my right (into the curve) I looked up again at the object with a deliberate intent of identifying the aircraft (I have always been fascinated by aircraft - and simply wanted to look at what I thought would be some variant of a Piper Cub). When I actually saw the craft, what I saw resembled a hovering 40-gallon oil drum -but I estimated it to be \"about the size of a contemporary Caldillac sedan\". It had a series of three rings of blinking lights - the top revolving in one direction - the middle revolving in the opposite direction - the bottom going in the same direction as the top ring. I tried to maintain a \"back-to-the-road-back-to-the-thing\" visual contact - but at my last gaze - it simply vanished. You may think this is flight of fancy or mistaken identity, yet the next day, the sighting was FRONT PAGE news on the DANBURY NEWS TIMES newspaper. The article quoted a Danbury police officer who ran home after his shift an retrieved his video recoreder shortly after dusk  in an effort to videotape the movements of the object. This officer was an aquaintance of mine (since he had married a college acquaintance of mine) - his name is indelibly etched in my memory. I saw the video not long after the incident, and it simply showed a very shaky image of a \"spot\" of light. It seemed much as if you tried to take a video of Sirius with a rather shaky hand. Yet the fact remains that the sighting was confirmed by a credited news organization and a police officer. Anyone can scan the (well the way they did it then) microfisches of the NEWS-TIMES for 9/75 and find the reference, unless the material has been supressed. I had for years, kept a copy of the paper , but as time has gone by cannot find it at hand. I do know one thing is certain - that what I saw that day was NOT OF THIS EARTH\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

On the 23rd of Dec. 1999 at about 10:15 pm an extraordinary light show of an unknown origin appeared over the Arkansas Valley near the small town of Howard, Colorado. I was alerted to this past sighting by a local resident of Salida, Colorado. This individual told me of the sighting through close friends of her's that were driving along Hwy. 50, along with many other witnesses who saw this bright light in the night sky... Some witnesses thought it was \"CHRIST'S SECOND COMING\" as the light was so profound and bright in colors of red and white, very intense and very prominent. This story is ongoing and in Salida, Colorado, the TRAVEL CHANNEL television show will be in town interviewing witnesses of resent and past UFO sightings this coming week The local paper the MOUNTAIN MAIL from Salida, Colorado, did a small piece on this sighting, and interviewed a local resident there on the upcoming TRAVEL CHANNEL Show. From my understanding this is a first on this sighting and along with the photo, which I will send later. Some witnesses need to be interviewed, we will post more findings later. R. G.

There were 80 foot trees on both sides of the road as far ahead as could be seen. It was at night when all of a sudden this huge object passed ahead maybe 100 yards ahead. Maybe 200 yards. It flew at tree top level and was as big as a 747 jet. No noise and it was traveling very slow. It had maybe 60 or 70 lights in different places. No certain order or anything. I have never ever seen so many lights on a plane in my entire life. I thought it was probably a military aircraft, but it had so many lights on it. I stopped the truck and we both just said WOW! What was that? We will never forget it. I know I will never forget it. I work for the City of Dallas ((deleted)) department. ((deleted)) years now. My friend is into real estate. He went to college in nacadoches, texas. I graduated from ((schools deleted)) Texas. I would say the height of it was maybe 60 foot high. We were headed to Sam Rayburn Lake in East Texas to go bass fishing with my friends Dad. His Dad had a house and boat there. We were maybe 50 miles from the Lake. The speed of this thing seemed like 30 miles an hour, but in the air it's hard to figure. That's about it. Just driving down an east texas two lane highway in the middle of the Angelina Forest and seeing a dark object the size of a jet or transport with so many lights it was beautiful. The lights were red, green, blue, white, maybe yellow, I can't remember. I wish I would have had a video going. It's been a few years since this happened but I felt compelled to send this to you.

I am situated approximately 48 miles S.S.W. of Fort Worth and 45 miles North of Waco, Texas. As a former commercial pilot, with instrument and multi-engine ratings, I noticed that this particular contrail had a base which appeared over the apparent S.W. horizon and the angle was so steep (probable 60 degrees) that it immediately caught my attention- I went to the window for further investigation (thinking, perhaps this is an airliner in distress) - runaway elevator or loss of control, etc.--when much to my amazement, this object did a abrupt verticle ascent from a fixed point- that's right- no pull up with a normal curve at contrail bottom- I'm talking about a change of direction, speed and ascent almost instantaneosly to the verticle- 90 degrees ascent and it accellerated as it went forward. Since the sun was setting in the Western sky and we had a clear sky this contrail and object was clearly visible, especially since it was reflecting in varying intensities as it passed throgh our upper atmosphere. I caught a very good reflection of the object with binoclars I keep in the kitchen- it HAD NO WINGS- EGG SHAPED, (not tublar like a missle) METALLIC SILVER WITH REFLECTIVITY OF BRIGHTLY POLISHED CHROME-- my estimate of altitude would be in the 25-30 thousand feet range when I first saw it... as it accellerated upward, the contrail was not continious, but rather sparoidic as if it were passing through different temps... I watched it till it disappeared from the sky..still in a verticle ascent- Good God, I thought this might have been a missle launch the way this craft behaved. The only major military based south of me is Fort Hood (approx. 100 miles as the crow flies) however, President Bush's Texas compound is prob! able 60 miles S.S.W- I called my parents, who live next door out to witness the event, but by the time they made it outside all that was left was the tale-tale sign of the lower contrail, except that the portion of the contrail that went verticle was still evident and they were also amazed as to the phemonenia. Hope this wasn't Saddam's avowed 1st attempt at retribtion. If it was however, our missle defense worked, because I'm still here to report this sighting. There was no sound involved in this incident. From now on, I will replace the binnoclars with a video camera. Keep up the good work.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness and found him to be credible.  We addressed the possibility that he might have been observing an airliner reflecting sunlight, but he thought that was not the explanation.  PD",

We got off the phone and I was finishing my cigarette when this HUGE thing rose up out of the woods behind my house with no noise but lots of lights spinning around the center of it.It was less than an acre in the back yard so however far that is, that's where it came from. It came up and out at an angle so I saw the bottom and then it straightened up and came across my yard and over the house. It was only on the tree tops (pine and pecan) so it was VERY low and made NO noise at all. I was watching and backing up to get inside at the same time. I wanted to keep watching but was TERRIFIED!!!! I ran inside and told my grandparents and they didn't know if they should believe me or not but the next day my grandfathers friend which lives across the street from him had been outside and he saw it too and said \"it was so low and so bright that you could have found a needle in the grass\"!!! so anyway that's my story. Haven't seen anything like that since but have had other things since childhood happen.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.  PD",

Rainier.\n\r\nI was in the left rear passenger seat of my car with my husband driving (my mother was in the front passenger seat).  First I saw what I thought was a falling star, a bright stream of light in the Eastern night sky falling in a slight curve for what, in my visual field, was approximately 4 inches, but was located a great distance away, so of course would have been far greater in length.  A minute or so later I saw a bit farther south but still in the Eastern sky a fast moving light that was first bright white, then red, alternating.  This object was moving very fast and again a great distance away.  The object, continuing to change from bright white to red, to bright white, etc,  then began to move in an erratic fashion, jumping forward quickly, then up and down in a zig-zag fashion--not straight up and down but more in a pointed sine wave pattern.  At this point, I said something to my husband, and he pulled the car off the freeway.  After he started watching the object, we saw it move backward, in addition to up and down.  We continued to observe this odd motion for as long as we could.  The lights from oncoming vehicles on the freeway made it impossible to continue observing the object.  I observed two objects (the \"falling star\" and the red and white lighted object) and my husband saw only the red and white lighted object).  I didn't think about it at the time, but on telling my sister about it today, she pointed out that the direction we were looking was toward Mr. Rainier, where there have been repeated sightings over the years.  Neither, she nor I nor my husband have ever seen (or reported seeing) a UFO before.  I am a medical transcriptionist and my husband is a skilled laborer in a paper mill.  We are not given to flights of fancy.  We do not drink alcohol nor consume drugs.  We are honest, God-revering, regular people.  I am 49 and my husband is 45.  As we both saw the same thing, I am sure that what we saw was a UFO.",

I was driving my girlfriend home one night, on Humboldt Rd. just passed over the highway heading away from the city. As we were driving up to the left I saw this circular light. The best way I can describe it would be that of light coming out of a lampshade that angles downward. This object was not very high, had absolutely no other lights such as a tail light on helicopters or any wing lights, and made absolutely no sound, or no sound we were aware of. The object travelled exactly the same speed as traffic. As soon as I saw it and realized it wasn't a glare or reflection I asked my girlfriend what the hell that was. She looked and watched it in awe. As we drove down the road watching it, it suddenly literally just took off. Instantly flew forward out of view, I've never seen anything move so fast in my life. It was very eerie, I felt excited because I knew I saw something that is very rare to see and something some people simply can't believe exists as they haven't experienced it themselves. I dropped her off and she too was shocked and knew she saw a \"UFO\". I haven't seen anything of that nature since. However, in summer of '99 I was swimming in the backyard of a friends house around 3-4 a.m. when we saw a blinking light as far as the stars. Now, this blinking light we found very odd, especially the individual whose pool it was because he watches the stars a lot, because this light changed direction numerous amounts of times. We would watch this light blink once in one area of the sky. About a minute later it traveled I would say the length of the big dipper and blinked again. Then another minute later it would blink up in a total different area as it had changed course. We watched this object for approximately 20-30 minutes. Very odd.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date, time, and duration of sighting all appear to be approximate.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Aircraft nearbyI witnessed a large circular row of lights that appeared directly over a jet I was watching and moved away at a rapid rate of speed.\n\r\nI was on my deck lifting weights and was between sets, so I was lying on my bench looking up at the sky.  I started tracking a jet which was moving rather slowly to the naked eye, as it was seemingly at a high altitude.  The jet was moving from Southeast towards Northwest.  Suddenly, a circular row of lights moved right over the jet and kept going the same direction the jet was going, only much much faster than the jet.  The circular row of lights appeared much higher than the jet and much larger also.  It travelled from horizon to horizon in what I have estimated to be about 5 seconds and was gone.  I found this rather odd; I have seen satellites before on a few occasions and this didn't vaguely resemble any I have seen.  I don't know why I'm reporting this, just thought you might like to know.  This is the second oddity in our South Missippi skies that I have seen in less than 6 months, which is how long I have lived on the coast.  Any suggestions as to what it may have been?

Well to get to our house you have to drive up a moutain, literally.... I remember looking out the back window of the car and seeing a rounded object in the sky and it appeared to be following us on the base of the moutain. It had multi-colored lights and they all blinked on and off simutaniously(spelling???). I remember my brother also commenting on the event and we were all astonished by what we saw. It was nothing like we had ever seen before. It was moving to slow to be an airplane, and it seemed to just follow us like it wanted to know where we were going, it gave us an excited but eerie sensation. After all we were all younger then! But we all knew that what we saw was ABSOLUTELY NOT AN AIRPLANE. Even to this day that is something that one can NEVER FORGET! I don't really recall the actual month day and year that we had saw this unusual - force - in the sky behind us, but I do recall that it was slightly cold outside and it was dark. slightly cold as in a SEPT. OCT. or NOV. kind of night. and another weird thing that I have also observed not only with the sighting that my siblings and I had witnessed, but as in others that I have read about or heard about, alot or a great percent is near a moutain... WHY? Do they want something from around or inside the moutains, is it better for them to sneek around near moutains, I don't understand but just thinking about it is a little eerie.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I was visiting home from the Univ. of OK for the summer.  My mom had told me stories earlier in the day about how she and a neighbor up the hill had seen a UFO a few times together.  I thought she was \"full of it\", so she said let's try to see it tonight.  We live in a vally in rural OK.  Not much light, so the sky is highly visible. We looked into the western sky with our naked eyes (where they had previously viewed it).  Only woods and creeks that way.  To my amazement we saw it, shortly after looking for it.  It looked like a bright star at first. But it proceeded to move first slowly, then sharply back and forth and up and down(no particular order).  It changed several colors, but it was so long ago that I can't remember the actual ones.  It was completely quiet.  We should have heard something if it were a conventional craft, because it was pretty close to us.  We didn't report it to authorities, but did tell friends and family.  She(mom) never saw it again after that night.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

It looked to be about 100 ft. off the ground. The light was changing colors from red, blue, and white or maybe more. The exiting thing about it was how it would move so fast across the sky. It would move rapidly sideways for about 1/4 of a mile and stop instanly, then move back across the sky and stop again. At one point someone said let's get in the car and drive toward it but we chickened out.  We watched it dart back and forth for about 15 minutes then it started slowly zig zagging across the sky getting higher and higher untill it was out of sight.

Then it stopped and spun around very quickly like helicopter blades and just vanished. I travel on the same road every day and have never seen anything before. The road is called the M11. I have never seen anything like it before and I keep trying to convince myself that I imagined it or it was a plane or something, but I keep remembering that at the time I kept looking at it for those 30 or 40 secs and saying to myself, \"I am really seeing this and I dont know what it is!\" Please belive me I have always laughed at storys about UFO's and I don't really belive in them even now but I really dont know what I saw. The road was quite busy so maybie some otther people saw it as well. Anothjer thing is that it was weired to look at.

This light was pretty far away, straight in front of us, from our vantage point just peeking over the tree tops. \n\r\nAt first I thought it was an airplane tower light but it seemed too bright and high.  My husband asked, \"What is that?\" and we started to explain it away-plane, helicopter, etc..  Then it moved straight up and straight to the left and repeated this movement as if going up stairs a couple of times, until it was high in the sky, like a very bright star, in front and slightly to the left of us. \n\r\nAt this point we were talking to each other- is it some military helicopter or UFO or what? Also at this point we were driving on a straight road and we had slowed down considerably.  Then the light dimmed from a bright white to a orangish color and began moving in a straight line directly to us.  It was weird because it was very far away and we never took our eyes off it but it was right on top of us too quickly.  It was like it moved very slowly and steadily yet it got to us faster than it should have. \n\r\nAt this point we had stopped in the middle of this road and turned off the headlights.  There was no one else around. The UFO stopped and hovered directly above our car and slightly to the left about 20 ft.? above us.  I'm not that great with measuring distance but it was right on top of us. It was about 4 or 5 times the size of our thunderbird turbo coupe, Triangular with rounded edges, apparently black in color and had many lights on the bottom.  Because it was right on top of us we couldn't see the top but it did appear to have a \"windshield\" on one of the points facing the same direction we were.  \n\r\nIt made no noise, created no wind that I could tell and even though it had lights it didn't give off light or light anything up.  It was slowly turning back and forth (left and right) but not all the way around.  From the time it reached us to the time my husband stuck the car in gear and went peeling down the road was probably only 30 seconds or so.  I felt like an animal, we were both crying and panicing.  The UFO crossed over the top of our car so that it was on the right side. To the right(out my window) was pasture and the UFO was flying at the level of my window-4 or 5 ft. off the ground (?) and seemed to be playing a game with us, it would stay along side the car, then back off and catch back up, shoot ahead and wait for us, etc.. this lasted about a minute or 2. \n\r\nI was looking from it to my husband who was trying to drive and screaming at him to get away.  At one point I looked back and it was gone.  We made a right turn and I was looking in the sky and found it looking like a bright star again, about 1 minute after it had disappeared.  We made another right turn so as it was directly in front of us, high in the sky and it just dove down into the trees at an extremely fast speed.  That was it.  \n\r\nMy husband is a plumber and I am a stay at home mom.  I wished for a long time that this didn't happen.  I've gotten past it now and try not to think about it too much.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

After walking along my property on the shoreline, I came to a road, which was once a highway, but now broken by the erosion.  I stood, looking in the dim light at the waves breaking and the driftwood being beaten on shore.  All of a sudden, I noticed a deep green glow.  I don't know exactly how it first caught my eye, but it became more and more apparent.  The intensity grew... and the deep green turned into an electric... or an increasing radiant green.  I was standing at North Cove of Willapa bay on SW Washington.  I was now looking into the entire 110 sq. mile bay.  The Hills at 2:30 AM were brightening and visible unlike anything I had ever seen in the daylight.  This light compelled me to look around.  I was wearing a baseball type hat.  Apparently, the brim of the hat kept me from seeing what I finally saw because I had to look.  Fifteen to twenty seconds into this electric green light intensifying experience, I finally looked up.  Through an opaque cloud cover, and over the moonlight, I saw a silver fireball.  (thinking, how could a silver fireball produce a green light?  But it was the way I recorded it.)  This object, from where I was standing, was as large as the moon, but moving downward from horizontal at about 15 degrees, and to the north (left to right)...  There was a period where I wasn't aware of any object, but saw some ground effect. Then there was the time I moved my attention to the object.  The total duration of the visual experience was around 20 seconds.  In retrospect, I'd divide the time to half observing ground light, and the other half to observing the object.  I have seen magnesium burn before.  The ligh emmissions of this object were magnesium like.  It trailed at a slight angle, from where I looked, located half way between Seattle and Portland. It looked to be a long way off and moving very fast.  Then it went dark.  As I pondered in the instant what had happened, I turned from the edge of the road and began walking up it towards a building I owned, located some several hundred feet away.  About a minute and a half after I started walking, about the time I was ajacent the structure, there came a crash which nearly knocked me off my feet. It so happens that I tuned into Art Bell the night after and heard him ask if anyone had any information on a sighting in the NW.  Two men from Everett Washington called, stating they had been out on break in the middle of the night when they saw this flash in the sky. Now understand this.  It was a miserable winter night.  No one had any reason to be out.  I was only out because of extenuating circumstances dealing with erosion on my property. Calling in the same hour I saw it, local law enforcement called it \"some loud thunder\". As I understand, subsequent to the experience, something hit the Gig Harbor area.  My personal feelings are that this thing came into the atmosphere around Portland, heading north/northwest.  Given the 150 mile covered in 20 seconds,  I'd estimate it's speed between 25 and 30 thousand miles per hour. ((name deleted))",

Still, to this day I am fully aware of what myself and four friends had seen. It was a warm, clear summer nigh's sky, no clouds or haze.  My friends and I were sitting in an area of a local cemetery, which borders a one-block area of homes, and then another cemetery.  We were sitting approximately 100 yards behind the cemetery fence at the entrance to a Family Mausoleum when I noticed a slowly moving, (almost hovering) object which appeared at what seemed to be directly over the fence of the other cemetery.  At first I thought the object was a helicopter slowly moving from right to left along the approximate fence area of the adjacent cemetery.  However, I then realized that there were no flashing (strobe) lights, nor was they're any sound at all.  Although, there was a very bright light (white/purple) at the center of object and one smaller illuminating light on each side of the center light. (At this time, no shape could be determined) We, at this time, moved to the fence area of the cemetery in which we were sitting.  By this time the object had moved slowly to about half way down the adjacent cemetery fence.  We all then realized that this was not a known aircraft of any sort.  The object was no more than 500 feet away from us at an approximate altitude of 75 feet in the air.  This was most apparent from the scaling of the homes that were between the cemetery, which we were in, and the cemetery fence, which the object was apparently following, and the tree line of the adjacent cemetery.  It was at this time I could just make out an outline of the object.  (The lights were so bright, that it was most difficult to see thru them).  I also realized that there was still no sound whatsoever. At this time, we all \"jumped\" the cemetery fence and ran as fast as possible around the end of the Block, (approximately 10 seconds) so that we could get even closer, if not under the object.  When we arrived, it was gone!  I visually searched the Sky and realized that there was nothing in sight, not even a distant airplane; the entire sky was void of craft.  Yet, it was clear starry night! I have created a digital rendering of what myself and my friends had seen that night which gives a good scale to go by.  A fist would have covered the object and one half at arms length when first viewed.

I have a telescope set up. I  looked at the light and they were perfectly round, no wings or other support structures several times brighter than any light in the Las Vegas valley. After about three minutes of viewing, the lights still had not moved, I noticed jet fighters take off from Nellis AFB and go toward the lights. The fighters turned toward the lights and appeared to be on a course toward the lights.  The fighters had to traverse about 2/3 of the valley to get to the lights.  When they were half way to the lights the highest light blinked out, about 15 seconds latter two more lights blinked out at the same time and the fourth light went out about 5 seconds latter.  The jet fighter flew to where the lights were and then appeared to go in circles for the next five minutes before returning to the base.  As the fighter was searching the area two helicopters also moved into the area.  I believe the helicopters came from the North Las Vegas airport.",

It was hot out and we had all the windows and drapes open. I was watching TV. My mom took the trash out by the front door and after a moment she came racing back through the house and out the back door, she didn't say anything to me at first and she didn't even shut the back sliding screen door. I was into my TV show and only just sort of noticed her odd behavior. After a moment, she began to call my name in a frantic tone of voice. I jumped up and ran to the back yard. I looked up where she was looking and couldn't help but see this huge, and I mean huge oval shaped thing that was just glowing with a yellow white light. It was right over our heads, but didn't light up the back yard or cast the light at all, even though it was like the brightest thing in the world. It made NO sound at all. My mom yelled for our neighbors, next door (their lights were also on). They came out and the four of us just kept looking at it, I don't remember us talking much at the time. After watching it a while, I could see that the glowing lights did seem like individual lights not just one huge light. It was bigger than a blimp size, more like 3 or 4 large blimps, but the wrong shape to be a blimp. The sky was very clear and there was no sound at all. Suddenly, it just took off toward the west, toward the beach area. It was as if one moment it was over our back yard and the next moment it was gone. We could see it go, but it left so fast, as fast as you could move your hand from in front of you to your side (holding your arm out straight).  I'm not sure of the date, but I was still living at home, so I had to be between 19 and 20, I married in Nov. of my 20th year. This was the third UFO I had seen. I think it was my Mom's first. I don't know about the neighbors.All three sightings were very different looking, however, all three were silent. This was by far the largest, the others were much smaller, and seen in the day too. This was the only one at night. After it left, I did call the newspaper, but they ! weren't interested, and didn't seem to know anything about it, no one else had called it in. I also called Miramar Air Base, and asked if they had anything that looked like this thing out flying that night. They acted like I was a nut.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

WE NOTICED NO WINGS.  THE LIGHT BLINKED ABOUT EVERY 2 SECONDS EXACTLY.  NOT 1 SECOND, THEN THREE SECONDS. THE OBJECT CAME TOWARDS US SLOWLY, BUT AT A VERY STEADY SPEED.  IT THEN STARTED CIRCLING US AT CHEST HIGH IN A PERFECT CIRCLE ONLY ABOUT 4 FEET AWAY.  IT CIRCLED US FOUR OR FIVE TIMES WITH THE LIGHT BLINKING AT A STEADY SPEED.  FOR SOME STRANGE REASON I PULLED A SMALL FIRECRACKER OUT OF MY POCKET AND MY FRIEND LIT IT.  I THREW THE FIRECRACKER AT IT AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT NEXT TO THE FLYING OBJECT. THE OBJECT THEN TOOK OFF AT A VERY FAST SPEED AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE.  I SAW ITS LIGHT BLINK AT ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY, THEN MAKE AN IMMEDIATE TURN OR CHANGE OF DIRECTION THEN THE LIGHT BLINKED AGAIN AT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS USUAL.

Lights were orange the color of streetlights and about 3 times brighter than landing lights.  I estimate objects at about 15 miles from williams gateway airport at about 20-30 degrees from where I was standing-except for the one which was close to the ground.  Sighting occurred in the desert.  Pretty flat, and farmers fields all around.(schnepf farms) is pretty close. No mountains around the lights, and no military ranges. I have video of the objects.",

The night went as follows:  My 2 friends and I were driving NNW on Highway 161 near Puyallup, WA when we saw an bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of approx. 5500' above sea level. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it's propulsion system(i.e. afterburner flames,exhaust,etc.)  I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either.(Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations.)  We followed it until it disappeared from sight approx.60-70 miles away.  It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed.  The object \"blinked-out\" at about 70 miles away.  One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations.  Also, judging by its flight path, it most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also.  The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was overhead. I am more than willing to talk about it further.  Please call with any other questions.  Thank you for your services.",

Many times they are seen in a triangular \"formation\" and sometimes as one object. I have seen these lights on two occasions, and from the vantage point of Niagara-on-the-Lake.  From the rocks at the end of the main street they are evident after sunset, and usually appear in the direction of Missisauga.  One, two or three orbs may be seen, often taking the form of a triangle (one object higher than two others).  They hang in the atmosphere, going nowhere but occasionally growing dim or blinking out.  They have been videotaped and computer-analyzed by members of a Buffalo MUFON group, and are solid objects.  There is a website (\"Orbwatch\") devoted to them.  They are well worth investigation.  They are NOT airplanes, unless airplanes hover over lakes and emit non-blinking, yellowish light! The objects may be seen at any time of year but are more obvious in spring, summer and fall.  The date of my observation is approximate.  I am certain that many who have posted here are seeing the same objects, and that they have been around for some time.

I was the primary driver as Debbie has MS and can't drive all that well.  We had stopped at a truckstop inside the Indiana line to allow me to get a few hours sleep.  At one point ((deleted)) started the car and drove to the next stop as I slept.  When I awoke it was almost midnight and I took over the driving from then on.  I am concious of being an abductee and am part of ((deleted)) study group.  I have only been able to have memories of the very beginning and or the very end of eppisodes.  I have felt someone standing on my bed or seen bodies next to me as I lie in bed, but I haven't been able to remember anything in between.  As this trip was coming up I essentially invited anyone who wanted to to \"come and play\" as I put it.  As I drove on toward Indianapolis after a while ((deleted)) asked if stars moved.  I said well they shimmer due to the atmosphere is that what you mean? She said no I'm seeing one oh no there are two no wait there are three lights moving with us as we are driving.  I couldn't see anything as I was paying attention to the road.  At one point during this period I openly called to the craft and ((deleted)) screamed \"Oh my god!\" when I asked her what happened she said that as I was talking to the craft what she at first thought was a very bright light in the fields next to the highway flew almost instantly toward the car and was next to the passenger side window for about 5 seconds as we were going 65 mph..  When that was happening I had the feeling like something was happening in my mind, I can only discribe it as a fuzzy vibration that was supperimposed and lasted till the ball of light sped away.  After she saw the light speed off she reportedthat the craft were having a light show of blinking on and off as if the ships were communicating with each other.  I was by this time anxious to see this all for my se! lf and a t the next turnoff went to one of the corn fields to stop and get out of the car.  I saw two of the three craft going away toward Illinois and one coming toward us.  ((name deleted)) freaked out at this point, she said it was because this was klan country and a white guy and Black woman were in danger here.  So I got back on the Highway and was told the craft was still following us.  In my mind I was saying \"if you want to have me talk to you you're going to have to get ((name deleted)) to sleep, she won't let me stop.\"  After a while she did fall asleep.  I waited till I was sure that she wouldn't wake up and took the first exit I could find. When I stopped the car in the corn field this time I got out of the car and saw a lowhanging cloud in front of me with the craft hidden just at the bottom edge of the clouds.  There were two sets of lights on the craft a set of blue lights on the top and a set of red on the bottom.  There were 4 or 5 lights visable above and below and they were going in sequence in opposite directions I never saw the body of the craft itself only the running lights.  I said that I was going inside the car now and if you want to come and get me you can.  I have no memory of what happened. But I was informed by friends of mine that they came to do a \"memory retrieval\" from me.  The entire evening there were no clouds in the sky except when I stopped to let them visit me.",

Before I continue, I would like to say that I am a believer in the UFO phenominum, but I guess when you actually see something, it leaves you wondering if what you saw was a possible sighting. The 1st happened back in 1987 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the town of Bessmer.It was about 2:30 in the morning, it was sometime in the middle of summer. I was driving home on US 2; the weather seemed to take kind of an abropt change maybe partially cloudy evening to a fairly hard rain. Well what happened next is what I have ?'s about. At the very 1st instant I thought I was experiencing lightning, you know how it lights everything up. But after the 1st flash that seemed to last alittle to long, just after it a green colored flash lit everything up and lasted a couple seconds. This sequence of white then green happened 4 or 5 times at about 1 minute apart from each other until I got up to the source of where it was coming from. Off to my left side maybe 150 to 200 yards away, ahuge circular white light appeared partially blocked in the trees. Then in the same interval previously described, two green lights, half the size, and on opposite sides of where the white light was appeared. As I tryed to find a place to safely stop and turn the car around to get a better look, the sequence happened one more time then it was gone and I never saw it again. Could this have been an electrical storm? There was no lightning bolts coming from the sky. It took me maybe 10 minutes to get home afterwards, and as quickly as the rain started it had ended with just a partially overcast sky\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

We were in Santa Monica, CA, aproximatelly 7 blocks from the beach and looked West and saw like a glow in the sky.  It was definitelly not an airplane as we know what airplane look like as we have the LAX and SM airports close to us.  As a matter of fact, we saw an airplane go by with it's blinking light clearly identifiable. Initially, this object moved back and forth (did not go in a straing line in one direction) for what seemed like a minute.  It did not look like a helicopter moving either.  All of a sudden it started moving north-west and it even created some sparks (the same as a broken mufler that's dragged on the pavement) and then it disappeard behind the homes in our view.

We grabbed the binoculars and looked thru them, it was evident it was not a flying craft that would be recgonized from any military instalation that is known to us.  This craft hoovered in the same spot for a very long time, about 20 minates before I decided to call the FBI. I was told to call the local police dept 911. I did so and one police car showed up within 4 minates of the call.  Then he got out and looked thru the binoculars and while doing so another showed up.  The first officer then went to his car and made a call, then without saying a word drove off like he was in a race. The second officer stayed there with us but walked away for a second to his car and made a call as well, at that time another police car showed up.  The third officer got out of the car and looked thru the binoculars as well and went over to the second officer and talked to him.  Then about 2 minates later the first car showed back up and jumped out and told me and my daughter who is 13 yrs old, that it was a weather balloon. I knew it was not as this crqft hoovered in the same spot now for almost an hour and the shape of it was like a disk laying down, then about 30 minates later it changed like it had flip to the side. It was now lookimg sidways. About 10 minates after that another light of the same sort showed up right below it. I knew at this time this was not a weather balloon. But they (the officers) would not tell me where this was being reported to. I asked if I could follow this investigation and was denied. Then all 3 of the officers took off.  The crafts stayed hoovered about 1 and a half hours longer and then dissapeared. It was very obvious that this was not a weather ballon.  I went on the websites to look up weather balloons and nothing I foun! d looked anything like what we saw.

Soon afterward, an identical craft appeared heading the same direction.  This one however was flying in a high speed zigzag pattern.  When the craft were overhead, all of the neighborhood dogs began barking.

The flash appeared to be about hand sized if you where to hold your hand in front of your face.

We had heard from friends which area it was sighted in and drove down that road (SW of Belleville).  At 8:02pm, rounding a corner and going west, we finally saw what our friends were talking about!  Bright, bright light, subtley changing from white to yellow to orange and was located on the passenger side of the car.  It was moving slowly, towards the north, it looked like.  Decided to stop at the stop sign to film it and get it sighted in with the binoculars.  As my sister in law was coming to a stop, my brother in law (drivers side backseat) started to get out.  Unfortunately, he got out before she was actually stopped and somehow his foot got under the car and under the cars tire, twisting his whole leg.  He was in a great deal of pain and couldn't tell us what had happened for several seconds.  He got out of the car to get control of himself and looked up and saw that the light in the sky had disappeared!  Both of us in the front seat looked and sure enough it had vanished from sight.  My brother in law later removed his shoe and sock to find much blood and a huge piece of skin ripped off his foot (about the size of small apple).  A day later he is nursing a very sore leg, especially the twisted thigh area. He is lucky not to have a broken leg. Strange happenings.  After going back to their house, I got in my car and rode back out to the area.  I didn't expect to see anything, but didn't have anything better to do that nite.

I looked out the window at the night sky, which is clear and pretty there when it is cold.  A point of light in the sky began to grow rapidly.  There was no sound at all. It grew brighter and larger, and closer.  I cannot tell you how I know that it was closer, I just know. For some reason it made me afraid (other than it was unusual)  The dogs moved from the middle of the room and crouched against the west wall, to the left of the window, looking upwards at the window and whining.  I could not hear any sound, but it seemed that they could.  The light grew so bright, it seemed to spread outward from a center point and lit up the entire sky.  Again, I don't know why I was so afraid, but I crouched down in the corner with the dogs against that west wall, so that I could not possibly be seen from the \"sky\".  This \"object\" seemed to be now very low in the sky.  From peeking out the window from time to time, it was my impression that it was moving very slowly to the north, but very near to the tree line.  Then the light seemed to be \"sucked in\" to the center point again. Then what was left at the center concentration moved suddenly and extremely fast in a Northwest direction and was gone out of my sight.  The dogs would not come out of the corner for some time.  I was afraid, and went back to the trailer and woke up my husband to tell him what I had seen.  He didn't take me seriously and just went back to sleep.  Eventually I managed to get back to sleep.  In the morning, I heard a radio report from the Salem area (towards the center of! the Sta te, about 70 miles away) that lots of people had called in the night before reporting seeing lights.  They were making fun of the reports, and I didn't hear anything else about it. If I could liken the craft to something that was normal I would describe it as a helicopter search light, except there was dead silence, and the light was so incredibly bright and actually \"grew\" outward to fill the sky.  I felt like it was \"searching\" for something.  dumn, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it.  I guess I got scared because my instinct told me not to let myself be seen.\u2026",

The color dropped off in a gradient, brightest in the center and progressively dimmer towards the boundary of the diamond shape. The diamond shape was thinner in width than in height. It hovered, and moved non-linearly. The size was approximately the diameter of a cigarette at arms length. While I was watching the object, I had a feeling like I knew where it was going to move, or that it was moving in such a way as to manifest my expectations.

One pointed out what we thought at first was a plane. All that could be seen was a blue ring of light that looked to be at a very high altitude. When we all managed to see it far up, it suddenly accelerated our line of vision, then as quickly as it started to accelerate, it stopped in mid air, and then zoomed backwards in a semi-circular motion. After this it accelerated again at a fantastic speed back in the original direction. Later on one (circa 15mins) of my friends saw it again returning toward the direction from which it originally came, again at a fantastic speed. Before the rest of us could locate it in the sky this time it was too late and had gone. Initially we were trying to justify what we saw, for instance lasers from a local nightclub, however we could see these as a shaft light led from the source up to the sky. It certainly was not anything man made that the general public are aware of, especially considering the speed at which it accelerated, stopped and then changed direction. Description: could not see any detail at all, condidering it was late and it was most likely very high up.m What we did see was a light blue ring of light the cntre of which was indiscernible from the night sky. The blue colour was quite  similar to the hyperlink colour on this page (where it says \"Click here to see examples\") although bright like a light and not a dull colour. The ring of light was basically all we could see, and it probably was a perfect circle. The friends I was with included a psychiatric nurse and a news editor (my cousin), whereas I was a student at the time, although now I work for an investment bank.

After watching it a few seconds, it changed course to parallel ours and headed south for a few seconds, then resumed it's original course, then headed south and then it's original course again.  The object was making incredibly smooth course corrections, with no jerky motion like a helicopter, and I didn't understand why it was jigging right and left. After it crossed in front of us (and my girlfriend saw it too), it came alongside what looked like a dark spot in the sky.  We could see three white lights marking htree points of a triangle, a huge one.  It looked a little like the \"arrowhead\" ships from the Start Wars movies.  We could make out the outline, and we could not see through it (the night was perfectly clear, and in the rural area we were in, we could see all the starts in the sky).  The triangle was \"pointed\" west, left-to-right base-to-point. We pulled into a convenience store in Hooper.  I got out and looked back over the grain elevators where we had seen the triangle, and still couldn't see any stars.  I did notice that there was a police officer parked at the convenience store as well, with his dome light on, and he was looking to the north (the direction we had just come from).",

I am the son of a private pilot, and know enough myself that small aircraft do not fly approx 300-500 feet above the ground at night unless approaching a lighted airport. There is no such airport for at least 25 miles, which is just a rural airstrip, with the ground lights activated via keying the radio mike (no need for landing lights). The craft had strobes that did flash, HOWEVER there were two things unusual about this.  First, the strobes were white (there were two strobes for sure, but possibly a third, they blinked so erratically that it was hard to tell), not normal for Canadian aircraft (standard is red and blue), second, they did not blink at normal intervals, they blinked randomly. (note: it is possible the pilot was flying without his nav strobes and was blinking landing lights, but they seemed of the strobe nature, not of aircaft landing lights.)  The lights passed over the road in an east-southeast direction, being nearly directly above my vehicle as it passed over the road.  Believe me, it scared me half silly.  It is worthy to note that two years (this summer) within 4 miles of spotting these lights there was a suspected cattle mutilation.  Of that I do have pictures which I took myself.  If you so desire I could get them to you within a couple weeks (I'm away at University right now, but will be going home in a couple weeks and could scan them.)<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I noticed a red light in the southern sky away from the fireworks, approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon, sitting motionless.  I asked my fiance if she saw it too, and she stated yes.  We watched it for a couple of minutes and it did nothing.  We both got up and went down to the parking lot and I got out a pair of binoculars to view it with.  My binoculars are fairly low quality and they did not help much, but I did observe something apparently fall from the light and leave a burning trail as it went down to the south of us.  Another guy was in the lot when we were looking at it, and I asked if he saw it too, and he stated he did.  I told my fiance to stay there while I ran up to get a cell phone to call somebody to see if they could observe it.  But while I was running up to our apartment, my fiance said it grew smaller and vanished.  While we were still out in the parking lot, it (or something similar to it) appeared or reappeared in approximately the same position in the sky, but only further to the east.  This light, too, vanished after only a short period of time.  My fiance and I both discussed what it might have been.  Could it have been a burning ember from the fireworks caught in the upper atmosphere winds?  We surmised not because we did not see any motion whatsoever.  An airplane or a helicopter?  Like I stated, we thought not because of the lack of motion.  An acquaintance suggested it might have been a homemade hot air balloon.  That seemed plausible to me because, when I was a kid, my dad used to make them out of sheets of plastic and sterno fuel.  Anyway, I know we were not the only ones to see this, because I've read other accounts of this on this web site and the next day on a local radio talk show, I've been told people were calling in describing the same object.  Was this of extraterrestrial origin?

Horsetooth Reservoir is located approximately 5 miles west of Fort Collins, CO.  It lies between two small hills, one to the east and one to the west.  The laske itself is probably 3 quarters of a miles in width and seven miles long.  The length of the lake is north and south.  At approximately 3:00 A.M. I received a call at home from the sheriff's office notifying me that there was some sort of a light flashing in the water at the very north end of the lake.  I notified ((name deleted)) who was in charge of the Lalrimer County Recreation District.  He said he would meet me at the docks at the south-west side of Horsetooth where I was going to board the patrol boat.  We got in the boat, headed out at Thompson's Cove and into the main body of the lake.  It was an extremely dark night.  I drove the patrol boat north at a reasonable but safe speed, considering the darkness.  When we got to the north end of the lake, we discovered the flashing light in the water that was reported as a possible distress signal, was actually a bouy that had been placed in the water to mark temperature sensing equipment.  A bouy with a flashing light on it had been placed in the water by the State Game and Fish Department.  Realizing there was no real emergency, we were getting ready to head back south when, all of a sudden, a huge, bright object appeared just to our east and just above the hills on that side of the lake.  I could not make out a structure.  It was a very large, oblong-shaped, brilliant white light.  We commented on it and couldn't imagine what it was.  I started moving south in the patrol boat when ((name deleted))  said, \"((name deleted)), this thing is moving with us.\"  I stopped the patrol boat and the object continued just a little farther south along the ridge and then it stopped.  We started south again in the patrol boat, the object continued to parallel us.  When we got near the south end of the reservoir, the object was still with us and directly to our east.  It loo! ked like it was a little lower above the top of the ridge.  It made the top of the ridge appear as if it was almost daylight.  We could see the entire makeup of the hillside, even shadows.  At this point the object started giving ((name deleted)) and me a bad case of the \"creeps\".  I stopped the patrol boat and we both sat and looked at the object.  I told ((name deleted)), \"This is getting too creepy.\"  So I shut of the patrol boat and turned off the running lights.  We sat in the boat quietly and just observed this extremely brilliant light.  After maybe 30 or 40 seconds the object left the area of the lake and in a split second headed north and became a tiny object someplace over Wyoming.  We watched the entire disappearance of the object.  The acceleration of the object was absolutely phenomenal and there was no sound whatsoever from the object.  I started up the patrol boat and turned on the running lights.  ((name deleted))  and I just kind of sat there and looked at each other trying to understand what happened.  When ((name deleted))  said, \"Do you need the publicity.\"  I said, \"No\".  ((name deleted)) looked at me and said, \"Let's go home.\"  I turned the patrol boat into Thompson's Cove, tied it up to the dock and we went home.  This entire situation really shook us up a lot and I honestly don't believe we ever talked about it to each other again.  I think ((name deleted)) is now deceased and since I'm now 68 years old, I think it is a good time to get this incident recorded.  At the time I did not want to talk to newspapers, radio stations, etc. and be in a position to answer any number of questions and opinions from all kinds of people.  When you are in public service the last thing you want to happen is to be caught in the middle of some kind of a controversy.  That possibility is bad enough when you are able to prove how, what, when, where, why, etc.  It would be a nightmare when, in the case of this bright object, all your proof disappeared in a split second into the night and was somewhere over Wyoming or who knows where?<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I'm sitting out there watching the planes take off and land. It's a sunny/hazy day here. I spotted, what I thought to be a flock of birds heading in a west-east direction through my front window in this haze. All I can see is small dark movements heading east. When this object was in view out my side driver window, it sort of came out of the haze and I knew it wasn't birds. It was a large black mass and as it moved easterly, it was again surrounded by this haze in the sky and disappeared in it. I carry my camera in my purse now, in hopes that i see something phenomonal, and took it out to snap the pic when it was highly visible out my side driver window. Snapped the pic and nothing happened. Looked down and seen that my batteries had fallen out. Jeezzzzzzzz! This has never happened before and this is a somewhat new camera. By the time I put the batteries back, in the object was gone.

Growing up I was an Air Force dependent and spent three years in the US Army 1966-69 serving a year combat tour in Vietnam. On the morning of Sunday, March 11, 2001, my wife and I took four of our dogs to Sarasota, Florida, approximately 10 miles south of where we live, to walk them at a place called Robarts Arena.  This is an area covering several acres and is where county fairs, rodeos, etc., are held.  I was walking about 50 yards in front of my wife when I simply heard the noise of a small single engine plane overhead and looked up to observe it.  When I first located the plane another object caught my eye.  This object was light gray and circular.  Seagulls are common here and I thought perhaps that it what I was looking at but it did not waver or move erratic as they do.  It was obvious this object was moving in a direct line westward.  I then noticed another object of the same description in what appeared to be about a quarter mile apart traveling same direction and speed as the first.  Other than the small plane's engine, there were no other sounds of aircraft.  There is an airport located in Sarasota and a McDill Air Force base located 50 miles north in Tampa.  However, my years around all types of aircraft left me with the certainty that these two objects were not normal aircraft.  When I turned to my wife and pointed to what I had seen, the objects were no longer in view.  After several hours of thought, I felt it should be reported to this organization.  There were no distinctive markings, lights, or other features; just to very light gray circular objects.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be a quite credible witness.  His description of what he and his wife reportedly had seen was quite precise, and described in unambiguous, objective terms.  We deem this to be a quite good report.  PD",

I lived in a house that is in a field, but surrounded by woods, it is the highest point in the town.  On a clear night it is absolutely beautiful, you can see everything in the sky, including all flight paths of planes crossing over you.  There was one person in the room with me, and my younger sisters were asleep in their room.  She exclaimed to me \"What is that out there over the trees?!?\"  The forest started maybe 1/4 mile away from the back of the house.  I looked and I figured it was just a really bright star, but then I realized I had never seen that star in that position in the sky ever.  I thought this was really odd because my family and I would lay outside and look at the stars all of the time.  I got a pair of binaculars to get a better picture of it and I saw that it wasn't just one light, like a star, it was two lights very close together, it looked like the headlights of a car.  It sat there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, and then all of sudden it became just one light instead of two.  I sat there and watched it with this other person, who I might add firmly did not believe in aliens or UFO's, for another couple of seconds.  Suddenly, the light went straight up into the air and hoovered at this new height for another 10 or 15 seconds.  I started to run around my house, turning off all lights, TV, everything electrical that was on.  In my mind somehow I think I was afraid that if it sensed electricity or something coming from my house it would try to land, seeing that my house was the only house in the middle of this big field.  I had never experienced any thing like this, I didn't know what to do.  At this point in time all we could see of it was this \"headlight.\"  Then, it starts moving across the field in the direction of my house.  There was absolutely no noise coming from it, there was just complete silence outside.  I was standing out in the open on my back porch so that way I could clearly se! e what i t was doing; I was terrified.  It continued to move very slowly across the field, I am not sure how high it was off the ground though.  It finally crossed over the corner of my house, about 100ft. above me.  It was a circular or oval type shape, I could see a red dim outline of the craft, like it had red lights all the bottom if it. It was still completely silent.  It moved over my house and kept moving across the field, but to the left now heading towards the trees on the left of my house.  I ran to the big windows on that side of my house and saw it go over the trees.  All I could see of it now was the faint red glow.  It went up over the trees, it raised straight up again and then I could not see it any more.  The other person and I did not know what to do.  We knew that we should call somebody or report it but we didn't know who to call.  She called our local police station, they didn't really say anything.  I told my father the next day about what had happened and he confided in my that he had seen \"things\" out there at night before too, but nothing that close to the house or the ground.  That was the end of it.  I have not seen anything like that since then, I do not live there anymore, but my family still does and as far as I know nothing like that has happend again.  At the time I was 16 years old, and the other witness was about 24 or 25.  I have always thought that it was extremely possible for these things to happen, but like I had mentioned before the other witness totally did not believe in aliens or UFO's or anything like that.  After this incident she does and is totally convinced that what we saw was a UFO&gt;\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date in November 1995 is approximate.

We came around a corner and saw a very bright light about a half mile away very low to the ground. When we first saw it, it was hovering over a hill top and shining a beam of light on the ground. We stopped the car to watch it for a moment. It then began to come towards us. We started moving again and it moved very fast to the other side of the road. As we traveled, it continued to move around us. At one point it stopped and hovered by us about 100 yards away. That is when I got a good look at it. In the distance it looked like a very bright light. Up close it looked like a saucer with a dome on the top of it. It was silver in color and emitted this very bright light from it. It made no sound that I could detect. It is very hard to describe the exact size of it, but it appeared to me to be at least the size of a house. Not humongous, but notsmall either. By then I was very scared and wanted to get away from the object. My daughter said she would keep an eye on it so that I could drive faster. We had at least 8 more miles to go and the thing continued to follow us all the way to the interstate. It stayed in the area for at least another minute and then vanished. I drove as quickly as I could to get to my friends house where I called my husband. He said that he would go out and look around. He called me later and said he had spoke to a friend of his that lives in the area of the sighting and that he had seen some jets flying through the canyon like they were looking for something.",

They were too small to discern any detail. They were about as bright as a typical airplane, but seemed a little bigger. I called my two friends outside to look, but they didn't get outside in time to see anything. I watched the lights for about 30 seconds total. They were about 40 degrees above the horizon, about 1 handspan at arms length apart from each other. I believe the one on the left was stationary when I first saw it, then it started moving slowly to the left away from the other one. (It was moving w.r.t. the clouds behind it.) It moved a total distance of about one handspan. The one on the right was stationary the whole time. Both lights faded out about 30 seconds after I first saw them. I saw nothing remaining after they faded out, and I never heard any sounds. I noticed that a car had stopped down the street.  After the lights faded out, the car drove over to the three of us and stopped. There was a couple in the car who had been watching the lights as well. They said they had seen them from the nearby freeway, and had pulled off to watch. They said they had watched for about 5 minutes total, and that there were three lights initially. Apparently this third light had started out stationary and then slowly moved to the right, away from the other two lights and disappeared before I had come outside. We all agreed that they were much more orange than the red broadcast tower lights visible to the east, and too orange to have been red airplane lights. The couple speculated that the flickering orange color looked like fire and may have been candles tied to balloons, except that all three were moving in different directions, which seemed strange. There's a very slight, variable breeze outside at ground level, and the clouds aren't moving noticeably w.r.t stationary objects. The weather is cloudy--no stars visible--and the lights were below the clouds. When they disappeared I couldn't tell if it was because they entered the clouds or because they faded out. There's a lake about a quarter mile to the south. I didn't think to ask the couple how far away they thought the lights might have been. Maybe it was just a prank, but I figured I'd report it in case anyone else saw anything unusual. I would guess that others probably saw it too since it was visible from the freeway.

Diablo.  I have never seen anything quite like this.  At first, I thought that it must be a plane as we have a lot of air traffic in our area.  But the object did not move, it just seemed to hoover there in the sky.  As I tried to keep my eyes on the road and watch the object at the same time, I noticed that it appeared to have colored lights, in a random blinking type pattern. Then I thought it had to be a star.  After I got home I checked to see if the object was visible from my backyard and it was.   So, I quickly unloaded my groceries, grab my binoculars and went into the backyard for a better look.  Through the binoculars, I could definitely see that the object was trianfular in shape with primarily bright green lights, it had sort a strob light coming off the left hand side and then there was a red light that seemed to travel in a circular path, counter clockwise around center of the object. It remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then it traveled very quickly up and to the right to a new position.  It remained there in its new position for another span of time, then quickly darted down and to the left, to another position in the sky.  The object did not move along with the other stars in the sky. I went inside and got my husband out of bed, I felt like I needed someone else to say that I what I was looking at was really there.  He watch the object  with me for about 15 minutes and finally said, \"Humm, that's kind of wierd isn't\".  The object stayed primarily in the same vacinity for more than an hour, making sharp, sudden and random changes in its position.   I finally went inside as it was getting late but my curiousity got the better of me and I had to go back out and check to see if the object was still there.  Only about 15 minutes had passed by since I came inside the house and when I return to my backyard to look at the object one more time, it had vanished.",

Diablo.  At times, it seemed to stay in one position, as if to observe something below, then moved forward, again.  The day was a bright, clear, cloudless morning.  The object was moving through the air at a lower altitude than I have seen many single engine planes fly.  It made no noise whatsoever.  It had no wings, no visible cockpit, no rudder, wheels, propeler, no cables or anything on or protruding from it.  I am only certain of what it was NOT: it was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a blimp, not a balloon, not a glider, or any ordinary object I have ever seen in the sky.  It appeared to move intentionally.  I did not have the benefit of binoculars, but with the naked eye, it appeared that it may have had narrow band of dark-colored metal very slightly bisecting the middle of the object, which gave the hint of an indentation or slightly \"segmented\" body, but I cannot be sure because it was further away from me, at that point.  Mostly, it appeared to be made of a smooth, cigar-shaped, bright white, non-reflecting material, i.e., not a \"shiny\" metal.  Because it had no visible means of propulsion, I was amazed at how slowly it was moving.  It's length was about the width of my thumbnail, held at arm's length.  The object was still in sight, when it was followed by a single engine plane that flew overhead, in the same direction (toward the northeast), but the plane was flying at a lower altitude.  So, for a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds,I had both the plane and the silent, cigar-shaped object in view, before they both passed behind the buildings and trees, and out of my line of sight.  The strange object was moving much slower than the single engine plane behind and below it.  It would seem to me that any observer in the small plane would have had a clear, much closer view of th! e cigar- shaped object.  I went in and called the FAA Office at the Livermore Airport, nearby, but they said they had no other reports nor did they see anything.",

It was evening and I noticed a bright light in the sky, in the West.  I first noticed it as we were going into Westpoint, MS.  I continued to see the light till we got home.  30 minutes after getting home I went out to my patio to see the light, but it was gone.  Tonight in the early eveing dark but still some light, I was sitting on my patio enjoying the nice weather, when I looked in the West sky and I saw my light again. I went and told my husband that the bright light was in the sky again.  It did not move, nor twinkle, it just stayed in the same spot as the one I saw when we were coming home on the 5th of March.  As we were watching it suddenly began moving westward then had a haze or glow all around it and began getting smaller.  Not like anything I have ever seen.  It was't a plane, that I could tell.  My sister in law saw the same light not long ago but she was coming from the west going east. She rememberd me telling her about what my son and I saw on March 5, 2001.

I usually observe aircraft passing from East to West along a designated flight path. Today, as I was rounding the corner near McConnel, I saw a very bright light moving from South to North. I thought that the aircraft I had been observing (which was now behind some trees) had turned on final for the AFB. I was thinking how bright the light was and that I had never seen landing lights that bright. I had to take my eyes off of it to make the turn on the road. Then, I looked South again to watch it, but it had moved beyond where I originally saw it.. Looking out the North-West side of my window I observed the fireball travelling North. A green shielding haze was on the front of the fireball. So, I really think it could have been a satellite reentering or a comet.",

The spherical object was traveling from southwest to northeast. The object appeared to be decending in an curved trajectory. I observed the bright mirror-like sphere pass in front of a cloud formation, then pass behind another cloud, and then back into view before it disappeared behind the mountain range peaks 5 to 6 miles to the east of my position. The sphere was perfectly round in shape and cast a pale greenish reflection at it's edges. As the sphere passed it appeared to have a faint vapor trail feathering off it's trailing edge/side which was a little bit more greenish in color. The sphere's primary color was an overall mirror-like silver. The speed of the sphere (as it passed) was faster than a falling object as it appeared to be propelled. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the object for approximately 7 to 8 seconds. The weather conditions were bright sun with some scattered clouds to the east of my location.

            "characteristics": "Left a trailAt the above date and approximate time, I was travelling northbound on Interstate 5 in south Orange County, CA area.  It was early to mid-dusk. The sky was cloudless. I observed two white jet trails, much shorter than what is normally seen and could just barely make out a craft at the front of each trail.  What caught my attention was that neither the jet trails nor the small objects in front(presumably an aircraft of some type) were moving.  They appeared to be absolutely stationary!!  It would be hard to estimate the altitude but I would guess 5-10 miles.  The craft/jet trails were positioned where it appeared that had the craft been moving, it would be travelling from north to south. As stated above the jet trails were white in color but were unusually short, much shorter than what is commonly seen.  From my perspective, they were both an inch to an inch an half in length. Additionally, they did not appear to disperse from the effects of the wind, as would normally be expected. The jet trails were not close together, separated by about 15-20 degrees horizontally. Since I was driving a vehicle, I had to divert my view briefly in order to drive safely.  At one point, I looked up and the plane/jet trail to my right completely disappeared!  I scanned the sky in the vicinity of where I had seen it and it was totally absent.   I had just seen it a few seconds previously. The object to my left was still visible. After about a minute, the object to my left then completely disappeared.  In both cases there were no remnants of the white jet trail as is normally seen. I am an investigator with an agency of the federal government, in my early 50s and married.  I have BS degree in Aeronautics.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We do not know what the witness witnessed.  We suspect he may have been observing the contrails behind aircraft, which simply entered an area of the sky where contrail formation didn't occur.

I remember a couple of days before seeing the object, I had trouble sleeping, and was having wierd dreams. In my back yard, we have a drainage Ditch,and behind the ditch at that time, we had several thousand acres of farm land. My backyard faces the West, and beyond the farm land runs the highway enter- ing Brownsville,from North to South. I remember that a couple of nights before, while being outside at night, I would see a ball of white light on the other side of the ditch.  I could recall seeing the light barely over the brush along the ditch, but for some strange reason I didn't think about it. I remember seeing it several times, and it did stand out, but for some reason I didn't check it out. But then on that night, I Decided to take my dog,(a Great Dane) for a walk, I would walk her probably every other night that month, late at night. It was a cool night, and it was clear skies, I walked to the back yard, when again I saw this light, It apeared to be moving slowly up and down. This time I became aware of how this light was strange, and out of place. The light at that moment looked like a street light, I went to the ditch for a better look, as I got closer, I could not see it, because of the brush.  The Ditch on the other side is higher than the side I was standing on, so I was trying to figure out how I could get a better view.  As I stood there, this bright light shot up from where I had seen the light, It was the size of a golf ball at arms lenth,this is the best I could describe it.  It seemed to be rotating, and changing colors, It was not very bright, as bright as a 40 watt light bulb.  You could see like vapor, like when you look at gasoline, is the best way I could describe it, you could see the colors change as it rotated, I can't remember though which way it was rotating(sorry), but it was rotating horizontally. My dog also noticed it, she was scared but did not bark, She had her tail between her legs. I stood there for about 15 seconds, trying to figure out what it was, but then I became scared, And I ran inside the house thru the front door, with the dog. I remember telling my self, that no one was going to believe me about what I saw, So I ran into the bedroom and woke my wife up, I dragged her outside thru the sliding door going to my back yard. My wife didn't know what was going on, I guess I was pretty excited, but she saw it also, but this time, it was starting to move to the Northwest slowly. It seemed to be shrinking in size, It got to the size of a pea at arms lenth. I had built a elivated platform for my son, so I climbed it, and watched it, as it dropped behind some trees in the far distance Northwest of my home. At the time I didn't believe in ufo's, I was just a regular Joe, Didn't really give it to much thought, but now I have become a strong believer. Thank You, PS My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time",

I was not involved in this incident, and am just going on hearsay.

From what I can determine there was an object hovering over the Power Plant in Clover.  I also have heard that the deputies attempted to take several photographs.  (again hearsay) Two of the deputies went to get a different angle to observe the object, but when they entered an open field, the entire field lit up (as if it were a football field on the night of a game) (these were the two traumatized deputies).  The Power Plant had a meeting about this event the next morning (known for a fact) but nobody is talking.  I just thought this might be an event that someone would want to investigate further, since there were 5+ representative of the Halifax SO to witness this event.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Report submitted by anonymous source.

It appeared to be, at first, an elongated string of lights.  The size of the object was difficult to assess due to its distance from us.  As we continued home, we tracked the object as it headed east towards New York City.  My fiancee got a good look at it at one point when it was directly to our north side and said it appeared to be cigar-shaped, describing as looking like a butter knife when light is reflected off of it.  Upon arriving home and stepping out of our car, we continued to watch the object as it hovered well off in the distance, quite possibly over New York City.  Again, the distance was hard to estimate.  When we looked back towards the west, we were startled to see that 3-4 other similar \"strings of lights\" were hovering almost directly over our position but far up in the atmosphere.  We went inside to further observe the original craft, which still hovered in the east.  Its lights seemed to pulsate/strobe in intensity and change colors (red, blue, green, white).  These objects (3-5 on average) have appeared nightly in our sky now and there has been a dramatic increase in plane and helicopter activity since their initial appearance.  We live near Teterboro Airport, but a lot of the air traffic we have seen is NOT conventional or commercial airplanes.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witnesses may be looking at a twinkling star, airliner landing lights, or perhaps some other normal phenomenon.

After she leaves, I often go out on the back porch to write in my journal.  The porch faces west, overlooking Blake and Vashon Islands and Puget Sound.  I had just stepped out on the porch and was admiring the clear night sky when an object traveling very, very fast crossed from the south to the north.  It caught my eye because I thought it was a shooting star, but then I realized that it was flying within earth's atmosphere. Moreover, it had least 3 distinguishable bright orange lights in an oblong formation.  It was too dark for me to make out the outline of the vessel itself. It flew at about the height on the horizon as a plane would, but was totally silent and at about 10 times faster -- it took about 10 seconds for it to cross the sky.  To reconfirm my thought that it could not possibly be a plane that had just passed, moments later one in fact did fly by (presumably coming from SeaTac airport as they often do), and I could make out its shape, hear it clearly, and it was much slower than what I had just seen. I took out my journal and wrote: \"3/13/01: It's dark and I can't see to write well.  I just saw something cruise through the night sky.  It had orange lights and was very, very fast and completely silent.  A plane just flew by, too, but slower - much slower - and I could hear it pass.  It must have been a satellite but it seemed so close.\"\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and believe the witness is an excellent source of objective information.

A flat plains area 10 miles east of Redding at the start of the foothills towards Mt. Lassen. Are view was slightly south of west from that vantage point. Fire works were @ fair grounds in Anderson . Anyway , aprox 9:45 while fireworks were going my girlfriend and I saw what seemed to be a shooting star going east to west . It burnt out , from our vantage point, right above the fireworks, but up in the sky a bit.(an open hands width @ arms length). Then right at the spot it burnt out this light started blinking . (The light was quite a bit brighter than any of the stars and didnt have a steady blink like a aircraft.) Then the akwardly blinking light moved horizontally tward the north we'd say half the distance between anderson and redding in a couple of seconds.(5 miles distance i think)Then it went south back over the fireworks, stopped, blinked a few times  then the blinking stopped and that was it. It def. was not any aircraft i have ever seen, my pops a pilot and i have grown up around avation, and that was no plane ! We could see the commuter flights going out of redding heading south and they were way slower and lower on the horizon than the blinking light.

But after the vivid clarity of this one last night, I felt almost driven to find out what's going on here...This dream was in very specific detail and extremely clear and in color. Last nights, had a combination of disc shaped aircraft and what looked like shining mercury-like material craft...they were zipping across the sky in the Seattle sky leaving a golden haze colored trail behind them. Several large ships with cylindrical engines on the sides and a round disc in the center of the engines (like the Star Trek ship only with the disk in the middle of the engines and other complex connective elements between the engines and disc (which was a dark green color) I noticed a small US Flag decal on the bottom of the craft and some other symbols. I also saw what looked like several aircraft but they were unusual, they seemed to be escorting the other craft. The aircraft looked like overblown A10 warthog jets...except the engines were huge and they were very smooth on the surface...with some non reflective material that was dark green almost black in color. When I was about 14 years old (I'm 42 now) I had a dream like this about similar ships landing at Moon Island near Hoquiam, Washington (in the 1970s) in that dream I called a good friend (who can witness this) ((name deleted)), and told him to look up in the sky...and he set the phone down (this is all in the dream) and went out to look into the sky...when I went back out to look up at the crafts all I saw left was what appeared to be one large star that broke into three pieces one fell over towards Moon Island (I was in Aberdeen) the other started desending toward me and I saw one headed towards ((name deleted)) direction several blocks North... A cylindrical object that looked very much like the old Apollo command module softly landed in my front yard and I called ((name deleted)) back and told him and he said something that looked like the LEM landed in his. Now here's the freaky part... the next day (this is NOT a dream) I was telling him my dream and he literally turned white because he had the SAME dream from HIS perspective...and remembers my phone call. Since then I've had many, many of the ship dreams and they are in incredibly detailed, color...I can see every detail of the ships...and I always wake up excited and hopeful like we're getting closer to something. I hope I haven't wasted your time...maybe this can help in some way, maybe it's nothing...but I just felt led to share this with you and if you have any suggestions or can offer any help about others that have had this dream or know what's goin gon I'd appreciate it. I hope I haven't wasted your time, but since I don't know if these are physical, psychic, spiritual or interdimensional issues, a dream constitutes on level of contact or reality to me and should be noted incase something else ties into it and can help you with your research\u2026\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We traditionally do not post reported dream sequences, since they are impossible to document.

It was reported on the 18:00 newscast on 03/15/01 that the station had recieved numerous call form viewers that observed the Mir spacestation and also observed another object with multicolored lights on a parrallel course with the spacestation. Mr. Burns also stated that he had contacted several agencies and noone seemed to know what this object was. It was also reported that a pilot had observed this object also, and had stated the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 100 miles.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectThis was the most usual sight I have ever seen, I swear to God.\n\r\nIt was around Christmas 1996.  My sister, myself and my niece were out looking at local christmas decorations.  When we had left the house I noticed a Bright star in the sky, it being Christmas I naturally thought it was the north star, yet it seemed extremely bright.  I have been a star gazer all my life and the night sky was clear and this star was the brightest object in the sky, I couldn't help but keep watching it.  I had pointed it out to my sister and we kept looking for it has we drove around.  About 30-45 minutes into our trip the object was still in the sky, like a star, it hadn't appeared to move it was high in the sky like a star and stayed in this one spot the whole time.  Then I noticed what appeared to be a plane coming closer to the object, I made a joke that there was a plane checking out this star. There was just a tiny green light in the sky like the green lights on a plane, it appeared to be approaching the star, then there was a red light that appeared below the green light also like a plane, I commented again that there was a second plane checking it out.  Then the lights both the green and red light got brighter and then it became apparent that they were a part of this star.  They appeared to rotate like the object was turning sideways and we were seeing the bottom of it.  The green light the red light and the bright white light together formed a perfect triangle.  I was amazed and told my sister and niece to look.  It slowly rotated around and then it streaked across the sky, faster than anything I had ever seen.  Then to our surprise it suddenly stopped,  it was on the horizon just above the tree line.  It slowly moved across the night sky, now only the white light was visible.  Then it went dark, then dim, the a bright flash and the 3 lights appeared again,  we were dumfounded. Like it's going to show us again.  We had continued to drive the whole time, this object had never left our sight we decided to roll down the windows to see if we could hear anything, there was no sound! . At the speed this thing had moved we knew there would be a sonic boom, but there was nothing. Then the 3 lights that made the triangle appeared and it streaked off again, this time going out of sight.  I couldn't believe what I had just seen.  I felt really strange, knowing if I ever told this story I would be looked upon like I was crazy.  I have always been a believer in UFO's but to see one was unbelieveable even to myself.  If my sister and her daughter had not also seen it no one would have ever believed us.  Actually I don't think anyone believes us anyway. I am an avid watcher of UFO television specials, and until last night when I watched \"Lights over Illinois\" I had never seen anything that compared to what I had seen.  The object that they described in that show was so close to what I had seen I think it even convinced my husband that I had actually seen something.  The description that they gave sounded like me telling my story to my husband almost 5 years ago.  He himself was amazed at how their stories had sounded like mine.  This is the first time I have said anything about this other than to my closest friends and family.  We too, live near an Air Force Base, I have seen many a plane come and go from there, but this was no plane.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>NUFORC has either received, or learned of, reports of dramatic sightings in both the U.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectVery large circular craft with engine problem, descends, stabilizes,restores engines and tests them.\n\r\nTravelling West from Philadelphia by car on the Schuylkill Expressway on my way home after work, noticed multiple orange flames, seemingly falling from the sky like a wobbling leaf descends. This sight was moving slightly from North to South as it descended, and I thought I was witnessing a plane crashing. Then to my astonishment, it stopped falling,stabilized [from the wobbling motion], and the [13] spurting tongues of orange flame I had observed, stopped licking out of their round-cornered, rectangular apertures, beginning to pulsate as colours changed to a hot electric blue-white light [behind the rectangular apertures,now].From this condition, the flame colours licked out again as orange coloured and returned to blue-white several times.When in the blue-white mode, where they ultimately remained, they always appeared to be behind the apertures, glowing calmly. All of this took place as I drove directly toward the thing's stationary position, later determined to be slightly South of the Conshohocken exit of the expressway.As I proceded closer to its location, the object could be seen to have a top side something like the tapering crown of a Mexican Sombrero, discernible by vertical windows suggesting that shape. These gave the appearance of back-lighted milk glass,with a steady non-kinetic light source, unlike the other lights aforedescribed. Those flame-lights were arranged around the lower edge of the object, ringing an apparently circular form at its bottom edge. Suddenly, as I approached more closely, the object took off at high speed, directly away from me, seemingly going from a standstill to perhaps 500 MPH, giving me the odd impression that it did not go through any intermediate speeds.At this point, I began to wonder if I indeed was seeing some new kind of plane going away with over a dozen engines, the rear of which I was observing.Then, without turning it came straight back to its former position, like a yo-yo returning to one's finger, and I knew this was no airplane! Still driving, by now I was almost under what I estimated to be its position, about 300-400 feet off the ground, at the exit area previously mentioned. Deciding to investigate further, I pulled onto the road shoulder when I estimated it was directly above me. At first, looking up, I saw nothing and thought it had somehow moved without my noticing it. Then I realized otherwise. It was a clear starry night and above me the sky was pure black for an area which I believe was 300-400 feet in diameter at the height I estimated for it. From beneath there was no trace of the perimeter flame illuminations, from which I concluded that their observed apertures were atop the bottom surface of what apparently was a gigantic discus-shaped object. The foregoing represent all of my observations. I exited the expressway at Coshohocken with the intention of stopping at the gas stations there to alert them to what was emplaced above them, but for some strange reason, I felt powerless to do as I had planned and felt directed to go straight home. When arriving there, I called The Norristown newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Willow Grove Naval Air Station to report this situation ,but was treated in all cases in a patronizing way as if I was to be more pitied than believed. After this, I took my wife and son with me to see this object, but By the time we arrived, it was no longer there,and they kidded me mercilessly on the way home . Nonetheless, I saw what I described to you and have no doubts whatsoever about it, since I had the luxury of observing this \"UFO\" continuously for 15 minutes, or more. My overall impression was that I had seen a craft whose propulsion engines were malfunctioning as it fell,that these engines were brought back to normal function when it stabilized, and that they were revved up and down for testing as it stayed in place and were then tested further with the out and back flight which appeared to me to cover approximately 5 miles from Conshohocken to King of Prussia ,PA and return.",

I did not ask to go in back or to see if the garden area to see if the ground was still dead. A short time after my expierence my uncle told me about Mr. Arnold and his UFO sighting.

And right now it's a UFO, until I manage to identify it. Saturday March 17th 2001, visible from 1:55pm to 2:03pm. Trying to figure out how to call San Jose airport. Moving due south, spotted in Almaden Valley, from our garden. May have originated from somewhere near the airport, which lies almost due north of here about 5 miles. Height anywhere between 2000 and 10000 feet. No loss in height. No noise. Highly reflective on this sunny day with light clouds. Estimate speed over 100 knots. Visible for 8 minutes from zenith to 30 degrees above southerly horizon, when dwindled to a point. No course deviations observed. Wife saw it at zenith (90) down to about 80 degrees azimuth. Called me, and we both then tracked it until it disappeared into the distance. No time for telescopes or camera; too busy trying to figure it out (hey, I'm a virgin UFO spotter so sue me). Wife asserts (too late for me to tell by the time I got there): * triangular * not a hang-glider (too fast) * not a balloon (wrong shape) * not a parachute (no height loss) * something swinging from the bottom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:45pm  3/17/01 I used to fly small planes, so I can say that as an ex-pilot I'm mystified. I called the airport ATC. * Nothing reported from San Jose ATC in the tower, except for a helicopter taking pictures close to the airport. * Wind on ground around 12 knots, little to no gusts. (So unless the wind increased to over 100 knots at a few thousand feet, this wasn't flying unpowered, therefore.) * Visibility: 10 miles. (So - and this is very rough - 10 miles in 8 minutes = 75 knots roughly. Agrees roughly with my estimates. Also, I reckon the visibility due south was more like 15 miles, which makes my estimate of 100 knots even closer.). A nice sunny day with very light and intermittent clouding. No clouds near the object for the entire time we tracked it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6pm 3/17/01 I expected to be excited and/or elated or something, but I guess today being tax return payment day, my reactions are dampened! Also, my wife got the best view, and all I saw was a bright, highly reflective object receding into the distance. We agreed that differentiating between a high large object travelling fast, and a lower, smaller object travelling slower, is damned difficult with no other nearby skycraft as references! There's some more info left out which my wife and I pulled together: 1. It seemed not to be metallic, but rather the texture of bright white silk. 2. The assemblage hanging down and swaying was entirely white, and the same colour as the triangle. It was about the same length as the traingle's span. The hanging part appeared to consist of a single U-loop of rope/cable, whereby nothing (e.g. a load, a person) was noticeable at the bottom of the U. 3. The triangle was neither thick nor thin; maybe 10:1 ratio between span and thickness. It appeared to be a rigid body, unlike the hanging assemblage. 4. The prevailing wind, according to reports, was between 5 and 12 knots, at every altitude from zero to 10,000' MSL. It was in direction 310 degrees (out of the NW), which lines up pretty much with the observed course of the object. 5. We also discount a helicopter on two counts a) wrong shape b) no sound whatsoever. 6. The course of the object relative to our south-facing garden (from where we observed it) appeared to be about one half mile due east, so it did not travel directly overhead. 7. At zenith, when only my wife was observing, the angle subtended by the object was approximately that of an object of size 0.7 inches held at arm's length. When I observed it first, at roughly 80 degrees azimuth, it was about 0.3 inches, and dwindled down to a sparkling point as it receded. 8. At the time of the initial zenith sighting, my wife had been looking up because of the noise of a passenger jet flying by (to or from the nearby airport). If the object were making sound, this could have masked it until it was too distant to hear. Hypothesis: an electric hang glider? Andrew Palfreyman San Jose CA, 3/17/01 I am a professional engineer with over 30 years experience in electronics. I have a degree in physics from Oxford University UK. I am 51 years old. My wife is 30 years old, and has a degree from a Michigan university in theatre. We were both drinking non-alcoholic beverages (and we don't do drugs!) at the time of the sighting. It was a sunny day in the garden with the children, and we were both relaxed and fully aware. We were both  wearing our glasses during the sighting, so long-distance vision was excellent.",

Instead we saw a large red light moving about in the sky in large circles. The object intentionally stopped near the moon for what seemed like a \"look\".  After two minutes, another light paralell to the other appeared. We now think this might have been the back end of the craft.  The lights quickly jolyed back and forth in the sky unlike an airplanes capibilities.  When reaching the moon for the third time the object shot down towards the earth as if landing but was not seen afterwards. We have three photos taken.

It surprized me so I followed it with my eye. I walked past the trees into my side field to get a better look. My sons and I star gaze at night and we have seen satilites. Much to my amaze there was three objects. They moved at the speed of satilites. A jet was flying underneath them tracking west so I new they were very high. They acted like they were chasing each other with one sort of holding back. Four times they made a triangle and then darted around more. This lasted for almost five minutes. After the stunts they went to the northwest and I lost them in my sight.  This was during the middle of the day. We can see real well in the sky. Out in the country.

I was fighting forest fires in california at the time and it was late about 12am - 12:30 in the morning and we and my friends was about to turn in, and a t that time we was laying down looking up and just admiring the stars..and at that time we all stopped in amazement as we saw these stars in a tiangular shape which was about 2-3000 ft above us, we sat and was struck with awe because we being from the Virginia we haven't never seen so many stars in the sky, but we watched it.  We thought it was a helicopter but we heard no engines, but it just sat there for about 20 minutes and then it started to move west but during this time we thought it it was something foreign because the triangle didn't break shape it stayed in the same formation until it was out of sight, I thought it was not to sound crazy, but i thought it was a spacecraft because i never seen anything like that in my entire life, but that's my story and i know what i've seen but i never talked about it because i didn't want to be called \"crazy\". but it was 6 of us that seen it and we said we wasn't going to tell anyone. That's why i'm glad i heard of this site, thanks, because i finally got to tell someone about my sighting.....",

Intercontinental Airport had opened the year before and I was very familiar with the landing routes of the airplanes.. I was looking at the few stars I was able to see when I saw a very bright \"star\" APPROACHING from the west. It grew larger by the minute with lights becoming visible all around the structure.  I remember that they were green and red and I seem to remember an amber light on the bottom of the structure. It was a silverish saucer-shaped craft, moving at an unbelievably slow pace, no more than a mile or two an hour with absolutely no sound at all! As it was almost directly overhead of our house, I jumped up and woke my younger sister, practically ripping her out of the bed, dragging her to the window so that she would also see it. She was groggy but amazed. I jumped up from the floor by the window and ran down the hall and out the back door. I stood on the back door step and watched it maintain its slow pace overhead, heading due east, directly in the path of JFK Blvd and the FAA!! As it slowly proceeded that way, I ran back inside to the telephone to see if I could get the number to the FAA so that they could witness this also.  I was so nervous that I dropped the phone and my father got up. I tried to get him to go outside to see if it was still visible, but he sent me to bed. This has stuck with me all my life.. I will never forget it. I dont know how long I was outside observing it, but it was a huge saucer, perhaps 125 ft across with maybe an altitude of less than 200ft. My sister for years had denied seeing it, but now we discuss it openly as she has seen unusual things in Mississippi where she now lives..\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We presume the date is approximate.

It appears as a regular star from a quick look, but once you take the time to watch closely you can clearly see how intense the light coloration can be.  I recently aquired a long range telescope for Xmas so i decided to put it to good use.  As i adjusted the lense on my telescope i noticed two distinct rings around the object.  The object was luminating so brightly that it formed an outer ring around itself. It was very clear that the object was rotating very fast.  The upper half of the circle rotated to the right, and the lower half of the object rotated to the left.  The rings had a tendency to wave against eachother as if they were on some type of axis.  The object was moving at a fast rate from one side of my lense to the other.  I also had to adjust my lense down because the object was moving farther away.  The lights of the object were in very distinct colors of red, green , blue, white, and a slight orange.  The objects movements were very sporatic in the way it moved from left to right at a high rate of speed. This object has been seen by myself and my mother for quite some time now for at least a year and a half i have made various attempts to contact observatories and other support systems and have received no response or cooperation. I truly hope that this creates some type of interest and investigation.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect this may be a description of the star, \"Sirius.\"  Just a guess.  PD",

It sounded a lot like an airplane except it also had whooshing noise, which sounded like this: woo,woo,woo, wuooo. Then I heard it stop maybe 450 feet directly in front of my window (I was in my room at the time, which is in the back of my house on the second floor). And then my curiosity got the better of me, and I got up and looked out my window. What I saw made me paralyzed - mouth open. When I finally got up my courage (it took 3 seconds) I said \"Holy S@*t!!!\" It appeared to look somewhat like the little dude's space ship from Space Jam. It was as big as two compact cars, one in front of the other, and one on top of the other two like a pyramid (although it wasn't in the same shape). And then it landed. This part is kind of hard to explain, so I'll do it as best I can. It flew for about 700 feet, then laned in a most peculier way. It landed kind of like the way that you see flying cars land, like the flying Delorian from Back to the Future part II.",

These objects appeared to be much higher, or smaller, or both than the passenger jets. They \"played\" in a spiraling motion much like what you would see in a \"Top Gun\" movie.  It could have been military aircraft in practice manuevers, however the aircraft were too high to make out any definitive shape.  They appeared to be triangular and shone in the sunlight quite briliantly at times.  After several minutes one of the aircraft departed in a Northwest direction.  It passed behind (over) the contrail of a passing 747.  I lost sight of the other objects when I looked back to them.  About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw two of the objects come from the Northwest loop around come together very close, split apart and both departed in a North, Northwest direction.  From what I saw no actions were taken that would be impossible for a military fighter, but it would have to have been performing to the limits of it's capabilities. It looked like they had the agility of a kite or bird, but were much too high to be that.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We presume the witness means March 19, not April 19.  We amend the date here.

I started driving down 112th south till I got to Olive Ave I made a turn right to get to El Mirage road and along the way I looked to my left and saw the lights by Estrella almost like by Avondale and Tolleson Area South by the mountains. There was one light bright orange or like a street light glowing on then off then when it turned off it turned on a little aways from where it turned off. Another that was kinda by it was the same color and stayed on bright and then another was above that one slowly moving upward and to the right. I had seen the one move east from the south and then I came home to tell my boyfriend and we went to go look about 8:45pm and there was nothing out there....",

So I turned-off the computer, and turned off the lamp, and headed downstairs. The hallway was dark, and as I passed by the north-facing window, I saw a bright light outside, above the tall trees jsut west of the window. I thought that it was one of the bright planets that are visible in the west this time of night, and stopped to look at it. But, it moved. The movement was slow - lazy - like drifting in the sky. The light pulsated - growing very bright - then dimming - and then growing very bright again. It moved from high to low, sort of drifting down in an arc. The direction of movement from here, was toward the town of Grand Junction north and west).When the light pulsed bright, it was as bright as Venus is now. When dim, could barely see it. Color - yellow-white. Size - not as large as Venus - more like the size Jupiter is now. Only saw it travel a short distance(don't know how many meters - can tell you that it was from the top of the trees to just before Redlands Mesa norht of me. Just couldn't see any light at that point. When I could no longer see it, I went downstairs and looked at the clock - 21:20. What did I see? Was this a space station? Was the pulsating light from the sun shinning on it when in certain positions? Why did it appear to be moving so slowly - drifting? It was intriging. I would really like to know what this object was.

It had flashing lights which had a definite sequence to them. There were about 10 lights in all.  They alternated in their flashing sequence from right to left as best we could tell.  The UFO must have been 10000 feet or greater.  The visibility was clear.  It moved up and down and then side to side in an \"A\" type motion.  It changed altitudes quite rapidly and began moving in an \"Y\" pattern.  After a little hovering, it moved in a \"B\" pattern. Then back to \"A\".  Then back to a \"B\" pattern.  It then moved like a \"T\", before performing a \"U\" maneuver and then shooting off in the sky at a high rate of speed.

As soon as I glanced up at it ,2 lights flashed twice and just before it went out of sight an entire bank of lights flashed all the way around the object.The object made no sound at all. It was really eriee to see something so large and so silent.As far as the size of the object,the best guess I can make is about the size of an average house. If I had to make a guess, I would say aprox. 150 to 200 feet long and 75 to 100 feet wide.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Changed ColoMothership Sighting over Memphis Tennesee on February 14, 1976\n\r\nIn February 1976, I was enroute from San Francisco to New Jersey to work on constructing a nuclear power plant.  I am a graduate civil engineer and I was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the Trans Alaska Pipeline to this nuclear power project in New Jersey. I was on the interstate bridge that crossed the Mississippi River driving east near sunset on Saturday, February 14, 1976, in Memphis, Tennessee.  This was the first time I had seen the Mississippi River.  As I was taking in the sights, I noticed a large \"structure\" in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights.  That caught my eye.  I was looking east at the \"structure\" away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the \"structure\". The portion of the \"structure\" I could see was about a thousand feet above the ground.  The \"structure\"  (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance.  At this point I was straining to see what supported this \"structure\" that was making this precise movement.  I could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the \"objec's\" mass and the pulsing lights.  I realized then this was not a \"structure\" but it was an \"object\" and there was nothing supporting it.  It then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. I decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the \"object\" to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground.  As I was exiting the interstate, the \"object\" began an exact horizontal move to the west.  The\"objec\" moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. The sun was still visible in the west.  The speed of its departure was so quick that I was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance.  I heard no sound from its departure nor did I see any evidence of propulsion devices. I later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the \"object\" departed.  I estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds.  The visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more.  That means the AVERAGE speed the \"object\" traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph.  If the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. Description of \"object\"  The mass of the \"object\"; was difficult to see when I was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that I only viewed the mass for a few seconds.  However, this is what I saw.  The \"object\"; was disc shaped.  I estimate its girth at 300-400 feet.  The thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet.  I believe the \"object\"; to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline.  It had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. I continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.  I could not obtain a copy of any of the Memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. I have not been back to Memphis since then, but I always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. With the advent of the Internet, I performed a search for UFO sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting.  The only information I found was about a UFO Crash near Cubatao River, Brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known UFO investigator)).  At the rate of speed I observed the \"object\" to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from Memphis to Brazil in a few minutes.  I tried to find out more information about the crash in Brazil but to date I have been unsuccessful. I certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the Memphis, Tennessee UFO, or who knows about the Brazil UFO crash. I hope to hear from someone.",

I walked out of the front door of the facility and stood on the porch.  Above me was a circular craft with lights (green, red, yellow, blue, white) circling the circumference of the vehicle.  It was not a helicopter, as the lights moved slowly around the edge.  The only noise was a low, almost muffled, humming sound from the craft.  It held its position relative to me steady, with very little side to side movement.  I was young at the time, but my memory seems to be that the craft was approximately 45 to 55 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 100 to 200 feet in the air.  I ran back inside the building and called to my father to come look at the craft, and when he and I walked back out approximately 2 to 3 minutes later, the craft was gone.

I was amazed to see that the time, date and location of one of the sightings listed on your site is almost the same as my sighting. I am a ((senior aviation specialist)) in Ontario, Canada. I and my friend ((name deleted)) were in the air at the time of the Feb. 26th, 1998 sighting above, that was reported near Ontario, NY. We too had a sighting. We had departed from the Oshawa airport and were flying on an eastward heading of about 080 degrees, eventually passing just north of St. Andrews, which is just west of Cornwall Ontario, Canada. ((name deleted)) tapped me on the shoulder, pointed out the window to my right and said,\"what's that?\" I saw an object that looked like the underside of a massive metal bowl with multi-coloured lights on it. This thing was much, much, larger than our airplane (a Piper Cherokee 180) and appeared to be tagging along with us at the same altitude (5500-ft.) about 5 nautical miles off of our port side wing. There were several different coloured lights on the object, some of which are not used in aviation at all. They pulsed from left to right slowly, dimmed out, then pulsed from right to left. The color pattern from left to right was: GOLD-RED-BLUE-GREEN-GOLD, then from right to left: GREEN-GOLD-BLUE-RED-GOLD. When the lights were not on, the thing looked semi-transparent. You could see the outline of it, yet it appeared to me that you could see right through it at the same time. I was very excited to see something like this, but at the same time quite upset and afraid because I was unsure of what is was or might do. ((name deleted)) and I were quiet for what seemed like quite a while, just watching this thing, then I decided to call Dorval Terminal in Montreal, Quebec. I said, \"Dorval terminal, this is Cherokee 180\"; (I'm holding my callsign until I know what is going to happen with this information). \"Cherokee 180 good evening, Dorval Terminal.\". \"We are on a VFR cross-country flight plan, passing just north of the town of St. Andrews on an eastbound heading and have traffic to the south of us at the same altitude. Could you tell us what it is?\"  \"Cherokee 180, squawk code (####) on your transponder and standby.\"  \"Dorval Terminal, Cherokee (call sign) squawking (####).\"  \"Cherokee 180, there in no know traffic at that altitude on our radar within a 60 mile radius of your area.\"   I couldn't believe it.  \"Cherokee 180, what kind of aircraft is it?\"  \"Dorval Terminal, I don't know. It doesn't look like an aircraft. It's got multi-coloured lights on it that go from left to right and back again and it looks bigger than a 747. It's massive.\"  \"Cherokee 180, how long have you been in the air?\"  \"Dorval terminal, we've been up here for a few hours.\"  Maybe you should land and stretch your legs for awhile, maybe take a break.\"  \"Negative Dorval, we'd like to keep going if that's O.K. with you, but you don't know what that is we\u2019re seeing?\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a u.f.o.

I said, \u201cStan whatever that thing is out there, it doesn\u2019t matter right now. We\u2019ve got to pay attention to our aircraft and flight plan right now, so let\u2019s do that.\u201d We resumed our time keeping and navigating. The next time we looked out the window, the object was gone. I asked Stan how he felt about seeing something like that and he said he felt sort of scared. I said, \u201cme too\u201d. I contacted Dorval terminal and they gave me a VOR radial (a navigational frequency) to track outbound, away from they\u2019re airspace. I set up the VOR receiver with the proper radial selected and began trying to track it outbound as requested. The needle twitched from left to right and no matter how hard I tried to hold my heading, no matter what I did, I was unable to keep the needle in the center. I tried the second VOR receiver. Same thing. \u201cThey were working when I tested them a few hours ago!\u201d, I thought to myself. I knew that Stan had no idea what a VOR was and what was happening, so I tried not to draw his attention to the problem. I looked outside for the object we had seen earlier, but there was nothing there. I had a look at my VNC (VFR Navigational Chart) and set myself a new course for our destination in Quebec. The ceiling started coming down and a call to the local FSS (Flight Service Station) revealed that the weather was below VFR minimums where we were headed. Also, I was amazed to see that the fuel gauges read only \u00bc of a tank on either side! I remembered passing a small airport a short while ago and decided to find it on the map, turn back and land there. I asked FSS if there was fuel available there and they said they\u2019d have someone waiting for us. We found and identified the airport quite easily, made the appropriate radio calls and landed safely. I had the tanks filled to the rim on both sides before we left Oshawa. I had been running the engine at \u201cbest-lean\u201d, to conserve fuel and get reasonable power, so I was surprised to see how much fuel had been used. I\u2019d never noticed this plane to have had such high fuel consumption before. It was as if we\u2019d been in the air a lot longer than we actually had been. We couldn\u2019t find anyone to buy fuel from when we arrived at there, so we called FSS and asked them if they had any ideas. They said that we\u2019d have to go to another nearby airport, about 15 miles away. I was told I\u2019d get fuel there for sure. Neither of us had enough money for a hotel for the night and cab fare to and from it, so we considered our options. At the time, Quebec had recently experienced an ice storm and was recuperating from downed power-lines, blocked roads and even food shortages in some areas. The temperature was probably between \u201315 to \u201320 degrees Celsius, so waiting in the plane all night was not an option either; we had to fly. Again I planned the route to our new destination and we took off. Enroute to our new destination I was in constant contact with Dorval Terminal and they gave me some vectors (directions/headings) to help out along the way. The fuel was running out fast and I told Dorval that I didn\u2019t think I was going to make it. Stan heard this in his headset and must have been terrified, but he said nothing. For some strange reason, I wasn\u2019t worried. All the events leading up until the end were so surreal. Dorval told me that I should see the airport soon and sure enough, there it was. I had to fight a crosswind like I\u2019d never experienced before. On final approach, I had such a great deal of crab (wind correction) in that it seemed as if we were flying at almost a 70-degree angle to the runway. As we got closer to the runway, the wind strength died off considerably and I was able to use the rudder to get more in line for our landing. There were fire and foam trucks, the local police and the Chief Pilot of one of the FBO\u2019s at the airport, waiting for us. We landed normally and taxied in. Along the taxiway, the engine started sputtering and when I went to do my shutdown checklist, the engine quit before I had a chance to pull out the mixture control. The firemen walked over to the plane as Stan and I got out. One of them took the fuel cap off and said something in French. Stan told me that he\u2019d said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in there\u201d! One of the firemen asked me in english what my name was, and when I told him, everybody including the police and Chief Pilot was roaring with laughter. I imagine the reason for that is that my last name is almost the same to the letter as a pilot who flew across the Atlantic in a single engine plane without knowing if he\u2019d make it or not. We got our fuel, had a bite to eat, I got the Chief Pilot to stamp my logbook and we set out to return to Oshawa. The trip back was uneventful and we landed with\u2026..plenty of fuel!??! I\u2019m not sure what happened that night, or if any of the events were connected, but I know what I saw. I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about our sighting and certainly have kept it quiet in commercial circles. I\u2019ve told a few people, but they all think I\u2019m either making it up, or that I\u2019ve got something wrong with me. I\u2019ve given up talking to people who are ignorant. I\u2019m ready to talk to someone that believes me, but I\u2019m still afraid of being ridiculed. I\u2019m not sure what to do, but it seems to be bothering me more than usual lately. Also, for some reason I keep having this vivid picture in my head of turning directly toward this object and flying in that direction. When I get the image of this in my head, I feel sick, distressed and the tears start coming out. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m starting to get worried about it.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>I will remove all the spurious computer glitches at a later time.  I can't get all of them tonight.  PD",

I listened to this for approximately 10 minutes then decided to go outside to see if I could see anything.

I then turned around to look behind the house and still did not notice any jets or anything that could be making such a loud roar.  But I did however notice that the stars looked very funny and continued to look thinking to myself that I had never seen them look quite that way before. They were red.  So, I then decided to turn back around and look in front again which is east, and as I did suddenly a big orange light appeared just above where I was standing.  Instantly I thought oh my gosh its a UFO. No sooner then I had that thought another big orange light appeared just to the right of the other. They were very big and just right there not far away.

With me was one of the store owners in his sixties, and the delivery man he is in his middle fourties.  As I walked out from under the awening covering the back door on a very clear and bright day I noticed the contrail of a commercial jet at roughly 30 to 40 thousand feet.  It was traveling in a south to southwesterly direction, probably more southerly.  The thing that caught my attention though was the fact that it's (the jet's) contrail was bent in an immediate if not severe ninety degree left turn.  I could see the jet and it's contrail clearly.  The jet continued on this new course for only a minute or so and then made another severe ninety degree turn to it's right to resume his origal heading.  As the airliner completed this manuever I noticed a tiny bright object immeadiatly to the right of the airliner.  This is where the jet would have been had it not changed it's course.  I then ran to my truck to get a pair of binoculars but by this time it had disappeared. The object appeared very small compared to the size of the airliner and had a highly reflective surface.  There were no visable characteristics other than this due to the high altitude. I asked the delivery person if he could see what I was seeing.  His reply was he could see something but could not tell what it was.  The store owners eyesight is severly impaired so he saw nothing but heard everthing we said.",

It moved at a steady pase,maybe 70mph.I thought that this was strange but went back to the pavillion.It was getting late and my sisters and I were going home from the church cookout.We did not have anything to drink.I got in the back and my sisters in front.As we talked I leaned over the front so I could here themwhen I noticed an object in the sky moving to the ground.It was spherical in shape and had a silver color,very smooth.It looked like it was going to land,I pointed to it and my sisters then noticed.As we got closer,about 100yards it slowly moved up in the sky and stopped.It was then about 80 feet in the sky and hovering.My sisters at this time are screaming.I told Diane to stop the car and that I was getting out when they grabbed my and said no way.At this point we are stopped and it is still hovering above us to the right.To get a better look without getting out I leaned back in the seat and looked straight up through the back glass.I got a real good look as the object was moving over us very slowly.It was real close,could have hit it with a rock.It had white,red,blue and a mix of colors underneath,and the lights were firing after each other in a certain pattern.It had designs underneath and I noticed then it was not round but had some slight corners.The object moved over the car and started to go higher,NO SOUND.The craft made no sound at all,it was 80feet above us and climbing and their was no sound! at all, other than screams from my sisters.It slowly made its way up towards a ridge and climbed over it and out of sight.This thing was in no hurry,and it seemed as if it didn't want to leave the area we first saw it.Anyway thats it,thanks for listening.Backgrounds of witnesses:Both of my sisters are nurses and I am a store manager now.Lets put it this way I haven't brought this subject up in 15 years to them.We just don't talk about it.I have been wanting to get this off my chest for some time now.Thank you.",

At the end of this 2.5 seconds it became very bright white light , like a light bulb just before it burns out, and suddenly went dark. At first my friend and I thought it was a meteor. After thinking about what I saw I am not sure. The meteors I have seen in the past fizzle out. This thing became very bright and large. I can't really say how large but from the size of the light it was too big to have just went out.

Observed 3 or 4 airpanes in night sky as is usual at any given time as a regional airport exists 5 minutes from my observation point and a major airport exits an hour to the North.  I happened to glance toward the East when right in my eye sight I observed two faintly visible, white, dim, non-blinking lights moving to the East NorthEast at what I thought was an impossible rate of speed for even a military jet, which is rarely seen around here. My assumption at that time was it was one fairly long object with one dim, non-blinking light forward and one dim, non-blinking light at the rear at an undeterminable altitude.  No wing lights seemed visible although between front and rear lights a very slight dim, white illumination seemed barely noticable along the edges of its body. The observed object was at about 60 degrees from my vantage point and covered about two thirds of the sky within approximately 5 seconds or so. Suddenly the object slowed down so very rapidly it barely seemed possible.  It seemed to just \"coast\" slowly for a second and it then just vanished.  Although sounds from the nearby airplanes could be heard, when the object I saw darted across the sky I thought I could hear a faint, steady sound like a hum of some sort but unlike that of an airplane or jet engine.",

I'm sitting here talking to my friends, yaddy yaddy ya, you know havin a good time.  All of a sudden, I feel a sudden vibrant movement of the house, I don't hesitate to think what the hell is going on, I quickly dart for the window, and right when I look out, to my own suprise, I see this triangular-shaped object just traveling in a straight line in what looked like 150 mph. This triangular object also had lights on the bottom of it. and red lights in the back of it. It wasn't flat, it was 3-demensional. It made a huge roaring noise. Right when I lossed sight of it, I could still see it, hovering, just sitting in mid air, all I could see at this time were the lights though. And all of a sudden, it vanished, and that was the last I have seen it. This is definetly no plane, helicopter, military base test flight, or anything else normal. It is the wierdest thing I have ever seen in my life and I'm still shocked over it. I think this is something that definetly needs to be reasearched or investigated.",

NOTE: This was NOT the MIR, as this event was the Monday before. At sunset this past Monday, several people including myself, all abslutely stone-cold-sober, were at a Texaco gas station located on a high hill, at the intersection of \"Exposition\" and \"Westover\" in West Austin. \"We\" consists of myself, a 50-year-old semi-disabled retiree and college student; my son, ((deleted))l, 28, who works for a prestegious ((deleted)) company, doing precision ((deleted)) work; ((deleted)) friend and co-worker, ((deleted)); two adult male Service Station mechanics. They were fixing a truck my sonhad just bought the day before at an auction, and we all met there to check out the progress. My brother, ((deleted)), a photographer, who didn't have his camera and I could just kick him, had just been there to check out Joel's truck and had just driven away. A few minutes after ((deleted)) left, around 6:30pm or so, he called on this cell phone very excitedly and told us to immediately go out and look to the West in the sky. He said there was this amazing streak of fire falling really slowly toward the horizon. By the time we got outside, whatever it was had just broken up into three distinct pieces, all of which continued to fall incredibly slowly to the horizon. I guess they wer e at about 40 degrees or so up from the horizon when we first saw them. ((deleted)) rported it was higher when he saw it, and it was falling very rapidly. apparently when it broke apart, it started falling more slowly? Anyway, we first assumed it was the \"Mir\" falling (we obviously weren't real up on the details about when that was supposed to happen last Monday, although we know all about it now), but then we were reminded that \"Mir\" wasn't going to fall for a few more days. I was immeditaely concerned that it could be our space shuttle, which was also up there somewhere. But whatever it was really seemed like it must have been bigger thaftn that. We were amazed at how high and HUGE this object must have been, since it was probably 15-20 minutes at least before it finally disappeared into the horizon. We rushed home and swiched on the news, but, amazingly again, ther was NOTHING!! We've watched all week, but NOTHING (but the \"Mir\", big deal. This object looked to be WAY West of Austin, Texas, as we were looking pretty much due West, I think. It wasn't dark yet, and we could all clearly see that this was in no way anything but something ON FIRE, not contrails or anything \"routine\". We've ALL been walking around in question marks all week! Help! Has anyone else reported anything? For the sake of our fragile sanity, we'd sure appreciate a quick response of some kind, if only to tell us you're checking on it.",

There I saw in a left to right diagonal pattern a \"fireball\" type object that was first white, then red, green orange and then appeared to have \"hit\" the earth with a large white flash. The event lasted no more than 3-4 seconds.  It was impossible to tell how far away it was, and I immediately thought it was a meteor that had burned up, and maybe even impacted.  I turned the AM news on and in about 15 minutes, heard a new report that others had seen it too.  Then the local Denver talk radio station made this event its topic for the next few hours. I called the station from a pay phone and told them what I had seen. After, I saw a newspaper article that had listed the phenomena to a meteor. I told friends and family of the event and had not really thought about it until Sat. March 24, 2001 when I was attending the Aztec UFO Symposium in Aztec NM, and a person got up and told of his sighting on the same night and same time.  I was encouraged to report my sighting by one of the presenters at the symposium. My sighting was on a very clear night and with no city lights nearby to dilute the image. I don't recall the moon location or if it was visible. I have seen many meteors in my life as I have always regularly wathched the Persiods showers and other events, but have never seen a flash, colors and trajectory as I did that night in August 1999. My backrgound is I  have a masters degree and am the Director of a Student Union at a college in Colorado.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>I spoke with this individual on 24MR01 at the Aztec Symposium.

As the pizza was warming I went outside to join my dog, and when I walked outside I noticed something moving accross the sky. At first I was confused by what I was watching, because I couldn't quite make out it's shape. At first it appeared to look round, kind of saucer shaped, then as it moved it looked almost cigar shaped. Suddenlly after moving about three quarters of the way accross the sky it's shape appeared more cheveron like. I should note that the backyard is on the north side of our property, so I was looking at this facing north. There was this strange silence to everything as the object flew accoss the sky, almost as if the object was sucking in the sound like a vacuum as it went by. The object had no lights, or light pattern on it, yet it was somewhat luminous. It seemed to be white, almost siver in color. The object flew from east to the southwest at about a 60 degree angle from the horizon, and that's the opposite direction of the flight pattern of the commercial air traffic in the area. It should also be noted that I live approximatly two and a half miles from Sky Harbor Intl Airport, so I know the flight patterns of the aircraft in the night sky. This object appeared to be rather large, and to be flying at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet in alltitude. It swept accross the sky at a speed at least 3 to 4 times faster than anything else in the sky. The object disappeared into the night sky to the south, southwest as fast as it had appeared in the east. The whole time of the sighting couldn't have been more than 30 seconds. After losing sight of the object I could once again hear the sounds of the other objects in the sky.",

We later returned to out car and there was no sign of the craft.  We told the sheriff but he didn't believe us.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

We decided to see how many shooting stars we could see.One kid said look there's one and after a while another said did you see that? We said what.He said that a shooting star came out of that bright star up there.he pointed so we watched the bright star.( It seemed brighter than the others) what we saw was not only objects come out and a light coming on and it shoot away a incredible speed.But then others coming back at incredible speed like a shooting star. stopping in front of this bright star.A beam of light coming on than disappeared into the bright star. We observed this for a while. We also felt a little uneasy.A cop car came slowly driving by so I went over to stop him and tell him.He got out but I think the strain on his neck was to much for him.

About 500 feet in the air were eight crafts that appeared to be making high speed ninety degree (90 degree) turns.  The gentleman noticed me watching and asked me if I saw them too. I replied with a 'yes sir\" and then proceeded to ask him, 'What are they?''. He replied 'I dunno.'  We watched these acrobatic crafts for almost seven minuets before six of them shot off to the north at a astounding rate of speed. The othe two craft just sat and hovered for a minuet or so and then shot off tho the west just as fast as the six to the north did.

The weather had a slight ground breeze and there was a slight haze in various areas of the skies due to airplane exhaust.  Other than that the view was well over 250 miles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and was commenting on the streaks of airplane contrails that were going east to west and vice-versa. I noticed a large 767 that was flying at about 40,000 ft going west to east just cross over and above a 737 going from east to west and was commenting about that also.  Then I noticed a larger than the 767 white object appearing to be stationary in the sky directly overhead.  I asked my wife to pull over and we observed the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly crawled across the sky at an estimated altitude of approx 50,000 to 60,000 ft.  It was not shining and was pure white.  It initially appeared to have small stubby like wings coming from the oval body but that was lost as the item was moving straight easterly from us. I noted the time of initial sighting @ 1105hrs and we were stopped by the side of the road for exactly 5 minutes watching the object.  We were stopped only 500 yards from the Prescott Airport (small planes only).  There is also a FAA VFR station approximately 10 miles NW of the airport.  There were a lot of commericial flights going east to west and vice-versa but those plane configurations were noticeable and identifiable.  I asked that we start driving North on Hwy 89 back to our homes at 1106 hrs and I watched the object as we progressed northward.  By the one mile mark past were we had stopped previously, the object not only had continued easterly but also had shifted to southernly view point.  That told me that the object was semi-stationary and since we were the ones moving that explained the object appearing to be more in the southern view. As we continued to drive north to our home, hoping to get a camera, the object was lost above one of the haze clouds from the lower flying aircraft.  I attempted to continue to track the projected course of the object but at approximately 1111 hrs I could no longer see any objects even in the clear patches.",

(sky harbor) I am familiar with most types of aircraft (civilian and military) and can usually identify them quickly, due to their low altitude. (about 5000 feet)  Most of the aircraft are Boeing 737's, moving from due east to due west flying the approach to Sky Harbor, though there are a few Air Bus 300's, Boeing 757's, and MD-80's. On Tuesday evening (3/27/01) at about 9:30 pm I was standing in my backyard. There were a few aircraft in the approach pattern, I would say one every 3 to 5 minutes. As I looked to the south I noticed an aircraft (looked like a Boeing 757) moving from south west, to northeast, passing just east of my position. I then noticed a very small, dim yellow light which seemed to be following the 757 about one and a half plane lengths behind. As the jet got closer (to me) the light began a slow arc to the northwest, executing a turn of roughly 90 degrees. If I had to estimate the size of the light, I would say it was less than 10 feet in diameter, based on its proximity to the aircraft. The strangest thing of all was the way in which the light moved. It was like a fish swimming. It continued on a northwest course and just \"blinked out\" after about 10 seconds",

As we got closer, we realized that it was comming towards us, and had what appeared to be blinking lights on the side. As we got closer to it and it to us, it became apparent that it was either close to the ground or very large, and had I believe 8 lights on it, 7 on the front in the chevron formation, and an 8th white blinking light in the back, located two inches(from my vantage point directly below it) from the frontmost light in the front. The front lights were varius sizes of cirlcles ranging from medium to large, with a red light at the \"nose\" of the object. The size of the circles were in no apparent order, but were symetrical in placement, i.e. a medium was across from a medium, and a large light was across from a large light. Once the object moved over the road, it slowed down to a nearly complete stop and shot out what looked like a faint spot light on the shoulder of the road at an angle of about 45 degrees from either the center or one side of the chevron. After the spotlight went out, it sped up, crossed the road diagonaly, and contined to move away from us towards the house at a fairly quick clip. At this point I called ((dleeted)) to tell him to get outside and see if he could get a look at what we had just driven under. I was on the phone with ((deleted)), who had answered ((deleted)) phone, for about a half of a minute when I looked out  the window and spotted another object, this time shaped like what I would call a classic saucer, only fairly  then what is normally reported.. like a sort of cigar, but more saucer shapped. It was moving over a field in the distance, complete with blinking lights that formed the saucer shape. It stopped over the field, sat there for about 5 seconds, then moved about three inches into what I presume was a different field, and stopped again, this time for about three seconds. Then continued its course in the same direction as the first object we had seen. My friend thinks that it was a helipcopter, but I havent seen helicopters with that many lights on it.. there may have been 6-7 lights on it, that appeared small from where we were. Also, from the distance that it seemed to be at, it must have been a very large helicopter, as it was about the size of a Altoid from where we were sitting on the road (we had pulled into a shoulder at this point to watch the object over the field). I was already extreemly excited over the first sighting, but this second one sent me over the top. I was yelling into the phone, \"oh my god what the hell is that, theres another one out there, look at that thing ((deleted))! Do you see it? Is that a helicopter? Jesus man its stopped!\" Then, as it sped away, I said something like, \"Holy *&amp;^@! Holy *&amp;^@! Christ man look at it!\" At this point I heard ((deleted)) say to ((deleted)), who must have been in the room with him, \"Damn man it sounds like ((deleted)) is flipping out, do you see anything?\" Shortly thereafter the object disipeared behin the treeline and we continued home. I couldnt shut up about it, while ((deleted)) didnt say much. I kept asking him if he had seen \"that first one\" shoot out the spotlight, and he would say yea, he thought so. PLEASE get back to me, I am dying to know if anyone else saw these things and reported them.",

No other lights were noticed in between the other white lights. These lights were very high up, probably much higher than any air plains that fly over and the three white lights were the same size as many other stars, as well as being as bright as many other stars. The reason it caught our eye was the formation the three white lights were flying in and they remained in that position flying at a steady pace overhead towards south Jersey. There was also no sound, it was very quite. The sky was very clear. While quietely watching the triangle of three lights fly over head in a straight line a sudden scurry of birds flew out of the trees behind us very quickly. I always thought it was unusual for many birds to want to fly in the dark especially in an area without much light around. After about 12 - 16 seconds of watching the flight pattern, we watched as the one front light went out (disappeared) quickly, which then the second white light then went out about a second after the first one and then the third light went out, dissappeared, after the second one, until there were no more lights to be witnessed. It was'nt that the object had flown way out of our sight and slowly faded out, rather it had not flown that far off before the lights started to go out one by one. I did not have my camera equipment with me on this night. Now a days my camera equipment goes every where with me. We had never seen an air craft with lights like this do this sort of thing. It had also seemed that this craft had to of been very high up because of the size of the lights and could not get an idea of speed. After we calmed down and discussed what was unsual with this object compared to an air craft/ air plane we finally headed home. When I came back home my cable was out and was unable to watch t.v., not that this could have anything to do with this event, but it did'nt help me to relax that night. I am a nature photographer of 4 years, my friend was in the Navy in the past. We had become interested in unusual sightings and have witnessed a few before and after this particular event and had become very good at knowing what does not move, or act like any air craft and if something does not have the normal lighting to an air craft. I would only be interested in being contacted for information by email or snail mail.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect that the witness was watching a group of three satellites, which were orbiting in formation.  We believe that they are launched periodically by the U. S. Navy, and we believe that they are referred to as the N.O.S.S. satellites.  PD",

Both clouds were in the east and one was the apparent size of a thumb, the other half this size.  I also noticed that the vapour trail of a jet was stretching from roughly the SE to NW and its leading end was obscured by the smaller cloud.  It is always my natural reaction to watch, for a few seconds, the passing of a jet as it goes overhead but as yet this jet had not moved from behind the small cloud.  It should have taken a second or less for a jet to travel the apparent width of this tiny cloud.  After maybe ten seconds I was expecting to see burning pieces of jet fall from the sky as this was the only reason I could come up with as to why this jet had apparently stopped.  Time went by, maybe 20-30 secs, I can't remember the time scale that well because I was just astounded that the jet seemed to have stopped.  Then I saw what looked like a triangular object, an isoceles possibly moving in a smoothly curving path from a point which was many degrees above and to the right of this small cloud.  It's apparent size was 2 or 3 times that of a jet, its surface was not smooth but appeared to have details which were beyond my vision.  It had no vapour trail and it moved faster than a jet possibly twice the speed, it is hard to compare since it moved in a long arc.  At this point I was aware that something extremely mad was happening and that something weird was going to happen.  This object, which seemed to appear from nowhere was swooping its way towards this little cloud where a jet was apparently stuck.  Incidentally the jet was still 'stuck' while this thing was making its way.  Obviously my heart was beating fast and my jaw was hanging and various expletives were repeating themselves in my head.  Anyway, as soon as the object disappeared behind this cloud, the plane popped out!  The object was gone and the jet continued on the same course indicated by it's pre! vious va pour trail i.e. SE to NW.  I am an amateur astronomer and I where glasses with weak lenses.  I have also seen other anomalous things when doing astronomy such as fast moving orange lights, which have also been reported by two others in the letters section of a UK astronomy magazine.  You just can't make this story up.  I am not seeking attention.  Just read this and know that it actually happened.  I will leave explanations to others.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous.

            "characteristics": "Lights on object12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape.\n\r\nThree of us outside Starbucks coffee shop parking lot at Paradise and Flamingo avenues in Las Vegas very early Thursday morning (12:40 a.m.), 3/22/01, saw an amazing display of a squadron of burnt-amber lights -- each coming from different directions -- zipping about a black oval shape in a highly coordinated, interacting, maneuvering display. To the south, the Luxor Hotel's laser beamed straight up, and we could see nighthawks illuminated in the lower part of the beam, but those were not the UFOs we are describing in this report.  There were no clouds. We were looking up at a 45-degree angle and to the northwest.  At arm's length, the entire system appeared to cover no more than an inch. Witness #1 first saw the lights moving like a wave like a sine wave, then changing to individual burnt-amber dots in a straight, non-waving line like a string of beads, then changing to a circular formation.  Then each light spread away from the others, weaving in and out from each other in highly coordinated maneuvering, each moving at the same speed but from different directions.  In this last configuration, the 12 lights were all zipping around a contained oval diameter, but the startling aspect to the movements was the highly coordinated maneuvering between the objects.  The entire system slowly moved north and perhaps upward until it was too far away to see. Witness #2 (this writer) saw the formation only at this latter stage, when the 12 burnt-amber lights were simultaneously zipping around the ovoid shape but each one coming from a different direction and going to a different location about this black ovoid shape.  All 12 lights stopped momentarily before again zipping around in different directions and not in sequence, but all around this black shape. This was done repeatedly for about two minutes.  The movements were fast, including very fast but rounded turns -- no zig-zagging. Mike Castrada, chief of the Public Affairs Office at Nellis Air Force Base, told me he has no report of this, which he would not have if it were classified, but he \"wishes he were there\" and that if Project Blue Book were still open, this report would probably be a case they would put into it. Castrada said that it appears we were looking at the Western part of the Nellis Test Range. Castrada said that \"various FAA and Air Force radars control all that air space -- about 12,000 square miles -- from 3000 ft. about the North Las Vegas Airport to infinity, and all the way to the Utah border.\" Castrada said that Special Forces was there on an exercise but only from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  He said that if they were flying at night, they wouldn't have their lights on because that would defeat the purpose.  He said Special Forces might have had perhaps four but not 10 to 12 planes. Witness #3 viewed the object thhe same length of time as Witness #1 but has not yet been interviewed in detail.",

As any one who has ever seen a U.F.O. can relate, I had kind of an empty feeling after my sightings. I could not tell you for sure what I had seen, only that it was truly an object that was flying and unidentifiable. The experience has never been explained to my saisfaction. The first time I saw something was in about 1979-80 the time was (pretty late I'd say 10pm) in Huntington Beach Calif. A group of friends and I had just come out of my parents second floor apartment, my buddy Brad saw it first; he had looked up to see the incessantly bothersome Police Helicopter that circles Orange County. This helicopter has a spotlight that it shines on criminals and the like, any way it tends to get a person's attention. We saw Brad looking up so we looked up, behind the copter, much higher in the sky was a grouping of bright white lights they were so white bright they were emitting a prism effect. They were in a triangular grouping not a formation, it seemed like one craft.  There were very high clouds that night and the light for this craft was reflecting off the clouds. We all were looking up at this thing as it stood still in the sky! Then we called my folks out of the house and even the neighbor came out see what was going on. So it was not just me, there was 7 people that witnessed this craft. Now the weird part; this thing started moving across the sky very slow, then it would stop. We realized the police officers in the copter might also have been seeing this. They were trying to get the spot light to shine up, I do not think the spot light was meant to go up. However, they were trying to do it. This thing started moving again then made ninety degree turns! It even went backwards once. We got a good look for almost 10 minutes. The lights were intense, it was nothing natural, and it was not a jet. The light sparkled all colors, a very beautiful site. Then it started moving one direction a little quicker, and then it accelerated across the sky so fast it vanished, this really happened! Right over the city yet, not out in the desert like you think. We talked about it over the years, we were no dummies it was not a plane or a Vandenberg launch (seen many of those) this was a craft, truly a Unidenfied Flying Object. I saw a second one years latter, but I got to go the wife is calling, Now that I know this site is here I will tell of that experience another time.

I could not tell its speed as I was doing about 75 mph, but it did not appear to be moving fast if at all. As I passed under it, the body seemed to appear much like that of a blimp or fat cigar.

I happened to look up in the sky and was really surprised to see a large object I would estimate at approximately 60-80 feet in circumference with a band of large square light panels undulating around its perimeter. Their circulation was in a wave like motion. I watched it as I also scanned the water for any impediments in it. I tried to figure out what the object was. I determined it was unlikely to be advertising as there was no message. The colors in the squares were yellow, red, blue, green.  I wondered whether it was something being held aloft by a helicopter as the object was not fast moving (about 20 miles per hour)but their was no noise associated with the object. I commented to my guests, \"Look at that, I will bet that is in the paper tomorrow.\" They looked at the object without comment because they could not figure out what it was. I had recently soloed as a pilot. I had attended the 82nd Airborne Division Intelligence course. I spent 13 consecutive nights in combat watching the night sky in Korea.

My hobby is watching the skies on clear nights when all the stars are out there.  Last night was one of those nights and I was at the rooftop of our building smoking one last cigarette before going to bed and watching the skies as usual.  Suddenly something filled my thoughts.  I felt it with all my nerves.  I said to myself \"something's about to happen\".  I started watching with a higher attention and at first I saw two shooting stars. For some reason I knew that the show wasn't over yet and I kept looking.  Then it happened appr. 5 mins later and it happened right in front of my eyes.  This one round light (10X bigger then a regular star) drew an S in the sky.  I just saw this thing...light make that S very fast and dissappear.

At about 8:40pm that Friday, I drove to a nearby gas station from my home to get a pack of cigarettes.  As I was driving back home I noticed a very large craft of some kind Flying relatively low in the sky.  It was about the size of an audio tape long wise at arms length.  I saw two lights at first thinking that is was two airplanes flying side by side in unison.  Then I realised it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light.  As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear.  It was three lights in a line with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernable shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it.   I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulless International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes ad helecopters that fly in this area.  For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound.  This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere.  It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view.  I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area given its large population.  Whatever it was, I think it was intended for peolple to see it since it was so large and flying so low.",

Being fascinated by all things in space I just stood there and watched. I lived by myself then and had no camera. I was so fascinated I might not have thought of it anyway. I had a very rare opportunity to watch this craft move very slow and was moving due west. I would guess it was moving less than 20mph I am not sure the duration of time elapsed  But as it moved closer I knew this was not a normal thing. It passed over my next door neighbors house and even cast enough light to see shadows. It move so slow that I was able to really get a great look. To my eyes it would be as long as a pencil help at arms length. And as reported by others it made no sound. I remember thinking \";there is no sound.\"  I told all of my friends and family. Drew everyone a picture and talked about it for months. About 3 years ago a friend call me to tell me he had seen exactly what I drew on TV. Wishing I had seen it to, life went on. Tonight on the Discovery channel I saw the show about sightings and so the video shot by another sighting. The craft in the video is what I saw. I could not ever describe it better. The really strange part was it flew backwards,  flying with a flat side first. I had not ever seen this footage until tonight. The cold chills that I had that night have returned.",

When I thought the moon had traveled through my shot, I went to look in the viewfinder and it was completely black, but then I noticed a quick, little white \"spark or flash.\" I kept observing this flash and can be heard on the camera's mic saying something is wrong with my camera. Later I put the footage in my editor, slowed it down and realized this \"spark\" was dancing all over the screen and in a few places can see more than one flash and with some enhancements can even see a rotation around these objects. One freeze frame shows the perfect shape of a saucer with blue and green haze.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, LandedA large red glowing \"plasma cloud\" appeared over the woods, then at least 11 smaller white circular objects were seen.\n\r\nI was 14 years old, and attending a boarding school on a small hill in the \"sticks\" of western Massachusetts, located close to the town of Chicopee.  It was a Saturday night; I and my best friend/classmate had begged off attending a slide show in the cafeteria, and were in our respective dorm rooms, studying.  Around 9:00, my friend was banging on my door and babbling in hysterics.  I let her in, and heard what I thought was an April fools joke about seeing a flying saucer.  I finally agreed to go to her room (which faced the back lawns and woods between the school and Chicopee) and look out the window.  There was nothing there but the woods and dark.  I was in the middle of saying \"there's no such thing as flying saucers\", when a very large red glowing (like glowing plasma) \"cloud\" appeared over the trees at the edge of the woods.  Now I was hysterically laughing and babbling and pointing at this thing, while it descended slowly into the woods.  Once it had \"settled\", we couldn't see it anymore.  But that was only the beginning - a few moments later, we saw white saucer-like objects flying at very high speeds and at unbelievable angles.  They seemed to be able to go from about 1/2 mile to 3 miles away in an instant!  At one time during this incident, we counted as many as 11 objects in the air at once.  Their movement seemed to be centered very close to, or right over Chicopee, although it was hard to tell because of the tremendous distances they covered so quickly.  We never saw any of the objects again, although there were rumors in our dormitory that several girls had seen strange things in the sky.  It was very hush-hush; nobody wanted to be labelled a \"kook\".  Understandably, my friend asked me never to discuss the incident.  It does take a bit of courage to report something this bizarre.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I noticed a red glow out of my passenger window.  We were a little bit out of Cloudcroft, NM and it was about 11:00 pm.  There was a red glow that appeared to coming from behind a mountain and covered a good portion of the sky.  I kind of looked like there was a big forest fire.  We pulled over once then drove a little more to get a better view and pulled over again.  The red was more intense in one area and seemed to lighten out, the further it went out to the edges.  There were also white beams of light the shot very high into the sky, almost to the point where they were over my head.  They beams were not extremely bright but stretched a ways into the sky.  There was also a time where there was 3 or 4 beams and then to the right of these, a could more appeared.  They just started appearing in succession from left to right. Every once in a while they would fade away they in a while they would come back again.  They never moved across the sky though, they would appear in different places but they were always stationary.  Another weird thing was that when their were about 4 or so in a row, they were all space the same distane apart.  Then after a little while, the red was gone but the beams of light were still there.  There were two other cars pulled over at the same spot that we were but I didn't talk to them so I don't know if they were looking at the light or not.  But we couldn't have been the only ones to see this, it was hard to miss if you just looked in that direction at the sky.  There are nothing but a few very small towns in that area, and I have never seen any type of spot light that can make a beam of light like the ones that we saw  It is the wierdest thing that I have ever seen.  I regret that we had no video camera or anything with us.  Well, I guess that is it, it happened about 4 hours ago, and I had to document it somewhere.\n\n\n\r\n((BEGIN COPIED REPORT))\n\r\nSubject:         Interplanetary shock wave strikes Earth's magnetosphere, auroras could follow\r\nDate:             Fri, 30 Mar 2001 21:13:32 -0600\r\nFrom:             \"SpaceWeather.com\" <spaceweather@lists.spaceweather.com>\r\nTo:                \"SpaceWeather.com\" <spaceweather@lists.spaceweather.com>\n\r\nSpace Weather News for March 31, 2001\r\nhttp://www.spaceweather.com\n\r\nA relatively dense and strongly magnetized interplanetary shock wave hit Earth's magnetosphere at ~0100 GMT on March 31st (8 p.m. EST on March 30th).

This was seen at night around the time of 1:30 - 2:15 a.m.   There were many round lights and they were all green. Not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center rows seemed to go around the object. Also remember there was more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one at the bottom of the center row of lights. A very close sighting and lights were seen clearly. Object was just below tops of trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little to no traffic. A road where there are woods on both sides and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (I think which is 538 or 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they occasionaly have trucks travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. I started thinking to myself as I was driving closer \"who would be playing with something this late at night like that\" or \"when did this light source get built and put up here\"... When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped and was looking at it.... I just started to realize that something was'nt right and started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was 'very' slowly moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. There was 'no' sound that could be heard from the object, and I was pretty close to the object. Panic set in and I said a few words out loud, which I won't write here. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body was shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o's until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of it much until I got a computer and was able to read up on information. I would also like to add that I am in excellent mental health, high IQ, never had done drugs, nor alcohol, nor have ever had hallucinations, and I was not tired that night. This is being told in absolute truth. And would be nice to know if any others had spotted this green lit up object in that area as well. 2 years later on another night, the same 'exact' object with green lights appeared again I think in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road, but for some reason while driving there I decided that maybe I'd go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to turn around.  Well this weird feeling came over me, I don't know why, (I'm in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror, I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights this time much higher in the night sky and the moon was almost fool this night. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the green lit up object farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these two roads at the time. This time I was thinking \"Oh my God, Oh my God, I don't believe this\" and \"It's back again\", with some curse words, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto.  I made it back home, and said to myself, why when I'm on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when ! another car was coming around the object would disappear or it's lights would go out... I did'nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. These days, I am now a professional photographer, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me. I am a 29 Yr. old female.

When thru an opening in the clouds came two saucer shaped objects very fast, then they suddenly stopped and hovered over the lake.the three of us were in shock to say the least. They made no sound like an engine would, but a slight hum was all we heard.they were about 75 yards away from us and about 30 feet above the water. one of the craft emitted a very bright beam of white light into the water. I flashed my Q-Beam at them just for a second it seamed then a bright like from the second craft shot towards us at the dock. I pulled out my pistol and fired one shot at the light.we heard a sound of the bullit hitting something but it was'nt like hitting metal.

We always used to cut behind the old Kmart that went out of business to get home, when my buddy says to wait up that he needs to stop and tie his shoe. \n\r\nSo we stopped and he went over to the loading ramp and started to tie his shoes and I just stared up at the night sky looking northward I could see the local TV stations antenna tower. \n\r\nStill looking out that way I caught out of my peripheral vision a streaking pastel green shooting star.  But as I focused in I could make out an out line it was football shaped and the object pulsed red, green, and blue (all pastel in color) up and down the length of the object in controlled rhythm. \n\r\nThe object was traveling west to east as I yell over to my best friend to look up. We were only able to see it for a few moments as it was traveling at an awesome rate of speed, as it dipped below the trees and house line. \n\r\nWe were dumbfounded by what we saw. I went home and immediately drew a picture of what I saw. \n\r\nBut that was not the end of my story. \n\r\nI went to school the next day to my electrical trades class and low and behold the was my teacher drawing on the white board the exact object I had seen the night before.  But not only was there the same drawing I had but in a story board fashion there were other drawings of it hovering with the same pulsing red, blue and green pastel lights, but another one next to it that included a star shaped little ball. \n\r\nI showed my teacher my picture and we talked about what each of us had seen.  He saw everything I saw but from his house he could see the object level off hover for a bit, then spit out the object that looked like a floating star.  He then went on to say the floating ball moved around the other object then he said it kinda exploded into about 20 to 30 tiny objects that speed off into as many directions.  \n\r\nThen the main original object sped off at an even faster speed straight up into the night's sky. \n\r\nI still have the picture I drew that night and that night is as fresh in my mind now as it was happening so many years ago. \n\r\nI will never forget the pulsating pastel red, green, and blue football shaped object. \n\r\nWith the exception of us three till now I never thought anyone else had seen this object till read the gentleman from Odessa recount of what he had seen that night.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date may be approximate.

We were in a small row boat on the lake just off shore near the point. After dropping the anchor and casting my line toward shore,I looked above the trees and saw a chrome ball just over the trees. At first I thought it was a balloon or maybe a beach ball, but the wind was blowing some and it didn't move. My Grandfather was fishing off the otherside of the boat and couldn't see it yet. I continued to watch it and noticed I could see the reflection of the trees below it. There had been a lot of talk on the TV about swampgas and such being the reason for people seeing UFO's. I remember thinking ,\"this ain't no swampgas\".After watching for just a few min. I said ,hey granpa look at that. I pointed so he could see. He looked at it for a while and then told me to pull up the anchor. I asked why and he said never mind just do it. After putting the anchor into the boat I looked back up while my Grandfather was still watching it. As I saw it just disapear in front of my eyes my Granpa said were going in. I looked all over for it and realized the sun was going down and the lake was now calm. I remember thinking it can't be that late already! But it was. I ran up to the cottage yelling all the way \"we saw a UFO\" My granpa told me to hush and when my father asked granpa said we saw something I don't know what it was . No one would ever talk about it again. Many years later I asked my dad about it and he sid granpa wouldn't talk about it.

I have seen these from my house, (right off Route 50) for years.... they are a very quiet airplane when they want to be as well, so the lack of noise is by design.  On a foggy night all you see is the bright headlight and landing gear compartment lights....very unusual looking.  We are also host to most every Blimp in the Northeast as there is ample space to post a docking mast.  Not unusual to see the Goodyear blimp as well as many other corporate blimps doing a stop-over.  One of those blimps at a low altitude and the message board lit up with an animation will turn your head too.  Just thought you might like to know the area a little.

PD)) I was working at my PC. The window was cracked open and I heard an approaching car and looked out the window to see if someone was coming down our driveway. We have a gravel driveway that leads to a country road. The driveway is approx 1/4 mile long. It was about 9:20 p.m. or so...I was not aware of the time at that point. As I looked out the window and saw the car was headed to another house by the main road, I noticed lights in the sky. They appeared to be those of a plane initially, but there was NO noise at any time! There were yellow lights and red lights and I was startled because it seemed to be flying at a very low altitude. It appeared to be coming head on rather than across the sky. It was located on the other side of the road, off the road, back towards the woods, near the tree tops. I understand that they were coming from the East. I continued to watch and then called my husband as I left the office to go outside for a better view. I couldn't get the words out because I had to sneeze and by the time my husband got to the front porch it had disappeared. I told him to wait as I was going to get the video camera as I felt \"something was very different about this plane and it would be back.\"  Only a few minutes passed and I returned to the front porch and I would guess it was around 9:25 or so. The rest is recorded on the video tape. I would say that in retrospect, that the so called quick movements made by the aircraft as perceived by me, probably resulted from my zooming in and out. I used the night vision mode. The camera is a Sony Digital 8 , Model DCR-TRV310.  There is quite a bit of air traffic in this area, BUT we can hear the planes without any difficulty whatsoever. That is what is very odd about this, unless the objects were so far away that we couldn't hear them. It was cloudy that evening and you could not see the stars with the exception of the one I recorded close to the moon. I am assuming that was a star. The \"planes\" seemed to appear from the woods in the East. At the beginning of the video there are two...which my husband  reasons are planes. They are traveling at different altitudes from south to north the best I can tell. My last shot of the event films an object going the other way, from north to south, back towards the woods.  (To be continued)\n\r\nMultitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky.\n\r\nPart II of report After reviewing the video several times in different modes, I might accept someone telling me that these are planes. But in order to do that, I want to video tape again, during the evening on a clear night and compare the two.  I find it very difficult however, for anyone to come up with any explanation for the visual display of rapid-fire light activity (similar to a seventies psychedelic rock concert) in such a small airspace. I find it difficult to believe that FAA would allow planes to fly so close to the ground and/or allow the number of planes (as represented by the flashing lights) we saw in such close proximity to one another. To take this further, IF you view the tape in frame by fame mode, you can actually see the smaller objects moving from one point to another, at such a speed and in directions that defy what I, with no knowledge of physics, know as possible. It is difficult to see initially, but the parts are noted with my commentary (which I hope you will ignore!) about \"twinkle, twinkle little stars\" and then later, with \"they are like mosquitoes.\"  There are frame views of the objects that show two round lights and also parts that show how the objects appear to be turning 360 degrees on an imaginary axis, then close up (like a clam) and move. On the frame by frame close ups, they look like a diamond shaped object. In one of the views , unless this is all my imagination or camera foolery, the object looks like it rotates, gets very dark on one side with a finite line showing a very dark underside and starts to collapse before heading to another location. Today I shot some more video of the area in daylight. Hopefully that may help in orientation of the landscape. Perhaps I am making more of this that what is actually there. But it is something I have never seen before. Also, I guess it could be tricks played by the camera and the way it films light? I have no idea. Would appreciate hearing what you think after viewing the copy of the tape.  Rather than emitting objects, which I did not see, I felt by movements that this was some type of exercise or manuevers and the object went back (not all) into another object? I know....CRAZY! End of Report\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We received the lengthy video tape on 16AP01, and we have looked at it several times.  We agree with the witness that the lights \"strobe,\" and we agree that they move in the night sky.  However, although we cannot be certain yet, our suspicion is that she may have been video taping aircraft in the distance.  We will investigate a bit more, but the strobing patterns are not inconsistent with aircraft, or perhaps helicopters.  PD",

I am a bit hesitant to keep reporting things for fear that I may be taken as one who \"jumps to conclusions.\"  I have seen several strange phenomena since my last formal report, but as mentioned above, I have been leary to report them yet again.  This all being said, I was scanning through the data base for this month to see if anyone witnessed a similar event to what my husband and I both saw when I came upon several reports from the same day that sounded too intriguing.  I feel that I must now break my silence and report what I saw... March 30th, approximately 1030 p.m... TOWN/AREA PROFILE:  I live approximately 4-5 miles southeast of the Pacific ocean in a small town.  Our town is relatively unpopulated in some areas, including where I walk my dog at night.  There are no overly bright lights on our street, the houses around our development or within the surrounding area.  I have never noticed any red outdoor lighting before. WEATHER CONDITIONS: We can usually see the entire night sky (stars, etc.) unless their is fog.  There was no fog this night.  It was about 50 degrees out. REPORT:  I had just leashed-up my dog and headed out our back door to take her for her nightly walk around the neighborhood when I noticed a very strange \"glow\" of red in the night sky.  This \"glow\" was pure red and looked somewhat like what was described in the movie \"A Fire in the Sky.\"  I know that sounds silly, but the glow spanned for quite a distance on the horizon.  Its strength and color intrigued me.  It appeared to move somewhat, but was mainly stationary.  There were many dogs howling/barking within the neighborhood at the time.  The \"glow\" lasted an unspecifed length of time.  I know that it was there at least through when my husband got back from walking the dog.  -I decided not to walk the dog after I saw the glow!   I repeat..this was NOT caused by any outdoor lighting and there was NO fog that a light could cast a reflective quality upon. WITNESS DATA:  My husband and I both witnessed the phenomenon.

When he needs to go outside at night, he usually waits until my husband or myself gets out of bed to use the washroom. My dog never barks unless he hears strange noises or someone comes to the door. Because of this, I thought him barking was due to something he heard downstairs. I didn't think anything of it. Seeing as I was awake, I sat up and he jumped off the bed and headed to the door of the bedroom, which means he wants to go outside. I had left the light on out back. I opened the door leading to the deck and watched him while I waited for him to finish. He had just been neutered the day before so I was watching him very closely to make sure he wasn't trying to remove his stitches. He walked down the deck and looked in a South Eastern direction. I kept watching him for about 20 seconds when I looked up and saw an incredibly bright light. The street lights on our main road are orange in colour and this thing was bright bright white. Because my husband and I had gone to his mother's for her birthday on the weekend, our camcorder just happened to be close by, so I grabbed the camera and video taped the light. When I was zooming in, I noticed that there were smaller lights next to the huge ball of white lights, but didn't see it until I watch the footage after. I tried squinting to see the huge object better because I didn't have my glasses on and I had just woken up. I noticed that it was round and had 4 large lights on top and 4 large lights on the bottom. The smaller lights next to the big one had two blinking red and blue lights, one white light underneath, and two other white light under the single light. There was also one small white light to the side of this last cluster. I don't know if these clusters were stars (too bright for stars in my opinion, plus they disappeared) or a reflection. I filmed this with the door open, and I couldn't hear any strange sounds other than the usual sounds at that time of night. I decided to go and get my glasses from upstairs so I could make out how many lights there were. I shut the camera off, put it down on my counter and turned to shut the patio door, when I noticed the light was gone. I picked up the camera again and filmed where it was. The small cluster was still there so I filmed that. I also filmed this morning, to compare where I had seen the lights to make sure it wasn't something that I was forgetting, like a baseball field etc...the only thing around that area is trees, trees and more trees....oh and one street light, which cannot be seen from my back deck.",

I woke up 2:30am(1993) in the middle of the night without even preceding a dream or a nightmare. It was weird. Then I knew something was wrong. So I got curious to look out of the window. I remember I always used to look at three bright starts in a triangular shape in the sky because I always felt something about them. I was looking out of the window for a few minutes. Then I suddenly noticed one of the stars (I always used to look at) was shining so bright, but nothing happened for a few seconds until I finally saw a bright object appear exactly from that spot with the same size of the star that I was looking, and was inclining in my direction (and growing bigger). I was shocked when I saw the scene. The UFO reached me in just about two seconds with so much speed that the scene was like slow motion and that was the scariest part of the incident. After it came right in front of my face, I was just looking at it (like if I was trying to explore something) without even getting scared. But after three or four seconds it vanished. Then I got scared again and I started crying. I couldn't believe it because I was a kid (11 years old) But still, I wonder why I woke up when nothing even happened and knew that I had to go by the window and see those 3 stars until a UFO comes out of one of the starts, exactly in my direction and right in front of my face and then it vanishes. At first the object was like a star. But then it turned into a UFO and it grew bigger when it came closer to me. The object was very bright and it had green, red and orange lights. Unfortunately the object was so bright that I couldn't even see how the body looked like. But after I saw the UFO pictures, I presumed it was like the large pleiadian ship (~20 meter diameter, 18 ports around rim, red/orange bottom)\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

We left early enough to go to Sunday school and church. We always exit Interstate 10 at the Pinal Air park exit and then turn south on Trico road. That morning there were a lot of military vehicles and personnel parked on Trico road right next to the air park. It looked like a military reserve thing. After church and lunch at the Grandparents my wife and I started back to Mesa around 3:00 PM. The military vehicles were gone by now. We were going North on Trico at about the Trico Marana road intersection when I noticed this aircraft making a banking turn and then descend below the tree line just like any normal airplane would to make a landing. BUT this was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. As soon as I saw it I immediately thought of the famous Phoenix lights incident, from the images shown on TV. I hollered to my wife look at that, but she didn't see it until it was a profile and didn't get a good look. The profile was strange too, it didn't seem to jive with what it looked like from the top. I have attached a JPEG I created of the the shape I saw when the aircraft was in its banking turn. The aircraft was solid black with no lights or windows that I could make out, but we were still pretty far away. When we got on I-10 I did notice a Cessna at about the same altitude I saw the black one in its bank and in comparison the black aircraft was much larger. I've been stewing over this ever since I saw it. I would be glad to tell anyone what I saw.",

I noticed a bright yellow light about a third the size of the moon travelling west to east (overhead) and apparently decending at a steep angle. The color was exactly that of a yellow traffic light, i.e. sodium yellow. There were four red lights, like navigation lights, around the rim; one on the forward side, one at the trailing side and one on the left and right. They were flashing on and off in a clockwise sequence as seen from below. As it decended toward the east it grew larger and disapeared over the roof of my house. I ran through the house, grabbing 7x50 binoculars as I went. Out on the front porch, I steadied the binoculars on the porch railing and looked at the craft, now at tree-top height and no more than a quarter of a mile away. My view-angle was no more than 5 degrees upward. The yellow light was clearly emenating from the bottom of the craft, which was flat and a bit inset. The craft was well-lit by the nearly full moon in very clear weather and appeared smooth and metallic, like new magnesium or aluminum but not polished. No seams or fasteners were visible. The over-all shape was that of a saucer with a dome on top. Over-all diameter appeared to be between 10 and 15 meters, with the dome taking up a third of that. the dome was flat on top and radiused smoothly into the sides, which were flat in cross-section, and had four keystone-shaped windows that I could see from my viewing angle. The sides of the top dome were smoothly radiused into the body of the craft, which curved continuously downward, and rapidly decreased in radius at the edge, curving under to the bottom. There was no haziness at all, and appeared as solid and real as a Cessna 172 flying along. Speed was maybe 50 kph. The interior appeared lit like an office at night, white and bright. No persons were visible, but a white column was in the center of the interior and took up perhaps a quarter to a third of the diameter of the dome, extending (apparently) floor-to-ceiling, and this could have blocked my view of someone on the forward side of the dome. Or it could have been flying on autopilot. Anyone with the technology to build one of these things would be capable of building an autonomous autopilot.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I had to run to our new place to take a few things over while she and my daughter atayed home. I was taking in the woods around us and looking at the field across the road. I heard a sound which was soft and different from other noises which a person would hear in this area. The sound seem to increase slowly and I was trying to see where it would be coming from and light appeared from no where. I was wondering if it was a air craft of some kind searching with a spotlight. When the sound was over head I seen these two shape triangle shape images or craft whichever it should be moving very slow. I was alarmed and there was no phone to call anyone because our new phone wasn't hooked up yet. Well, I was afraid and did not know what to do. Go to the car and get out of the area ? well I went inside on the trailer and watch there where color lights also red, light blue and a off white dusty light which was scanning the ground across the road. It seemed forever but as soon as they started to desend they quickly went. It looked like a burst of energy but the sound was soft but a tone louder. I did not report it to any offical because of being made a fool out of. I do not drink, I do not do drugs and do not smoke. I know what I saw and that will never leave me.",

My window looks to the west.  Sunset had occured and I had noticed the pink clouds low on the horizon shortly before the event.  It was approx. 7:10 or 7:15 and both my cat and I saw two firey objects streak acorss the upper portion of the window (which would probably be about 70-90 degress from the horizon.  These two objects were moving from the south to north, low and it almost appeared that they were below the clould level.  They were both yellow-orange in color, and appeared to leave a trail or had a trail as the streaked acorss our line of vision.  They were moving fast in a horizontal movement, slightly rising.  They were almost parallel with each other, possibly one slighty postioned behind the first.  It was not totally dark as I could see the clouds, yet the lights from the objects was bright, nearly as bright as the reflection a few minutes later of my interior fan light on the window.  As soon as they streaked by, I said out loud to my cat, What was that!  He had definitely noticed at the same time I had.  I jumped up and ran into my living room so I could see the north exposure.  (I live close to the Red Rocks at the uptown area of Sedona).  I could see nothing in the darkening sky, except a few clouds.  I would say it looked similar to rockects being fired--and/or metorites, although I have never seen metorites of that color or at that time of the evening--nor even in that particular movement horizontally across the sky.",

West-to-East\n\r\nObserver #1: Myself. I am an engineering drafter of 24 years. Observer #2: My close friend who was a waitress, and the driver of the vehicle we were in during this event. While traveling East on the Ventura fwy (hwy 101), our car approached the halfway point between Winnetka Blvd &amp; Tampa Blvd (this would be at Corbin Ave) when the event began. As the passenger in the front seat, I had been facing to my left (North) while speaking with my friend. At this point near Cornin Ave, I took brief notice of an intense, red light in the far corner of my left eye. I assumed for a split second that a helicopters nav light was responsible for the bright glow. What initially drew my attention was the low altitude of the objects flight path(approx 90-120ft): By looking level thru the drivers side windows, the object was clearly visible. I looked away momentarily as I was in conversation, but returning my stare almost immediately. \"It\" was travelling East, slightly faster than traffic (65mph) and was moving parallel to the fwy trafic. With my attention now sharply focused on the object in question, we could see that 5 (five) objects were clearly in a flight formation: a straight, level line extending perpendicular to the fwy structure, and only about 200-300ft from the fwy. The objects were identical in every describable aspect,... and all were sparkling (not flaming) beautiful red spheres. The spheres were approx 30ft in diameter, and approx 120ft center-to-center. Not only were background urban features visible between spheres, but very subtle, yet distinct vertical variations of the altitude of individual spherical entities confirmed that they were indeed not (physically observable) conjoined entities. During this entire event, at no point did the entities appear to deviate from the estimated altitude/speed/direction/distance: Making for an exceptional viewpoint for us, for the duration. Beyond the point being perpendicular to my vehicle (&amp; while the entities briefly appeared as a singularity) and where \"individuals\" were clearly visible again, something radical in their orientation to one another developed rapidly. Each of the outermost two spheres began, simultaneously, to close the gap between its nearest neighbor in flight: encroaching on the sphere next to it!: I feared some sort of accident and/or crash. However, there were no visible cautionary measures taken by the two spheres apparently being jeopardized. In fact, the moving two entities simply continued on their collision course, to eventually meld with the neighboring spheres: All of which now totalled three! Very soon afterwards (only seconds), the outermost pair of entities embarked on the same course of action as their previously described counterparts,... and melded with the central spherical figure, and with the same methodical ease! Only one entity existed now. Note: At no point did any sphere, individual or combined or \"transitional\", exhibit any deviation from the original observed color/shape/speed/altitude/direction. Within a few moments, our \"companion\" sphere (now approx 1/4mi ahead of us) quite casually split into two distinct entities,... and similarly, each of the new pair divided themselves, now formimg a group of four individuals. This talley was not observed to change. It appeared as though the unusual \"transformations\" within this event transpired over approx one minute. Since \"they\" had been travelling slightly faster than traffic, the theatrics of combining &amp; dividing had ceased when the group of spheres was approx 1/2-3/4mi ahead of my vehicle. By their brightness, this new group of four spheres was clearly visible up to approx 2mi away. The pitch of the fwy eventually severed our line-of-sight view. We were left astonished. It seems evident that my friend &amp; I were in perfect position to view the intelligent flight management display of either directly or remotely operated craft,... or simply that of \"Light Beings\" or pure consiousness. I am to this day, grateful for that night. This was my 8th sighting, and the 2nd for my friend, who also saw her first one with me approx 6mo earlier. I will write of this one in future.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

This was not suprising, as a small airport is a few miles north.  I soon realized that the roaring was intensifing, rather than diminishing.

The lights were arranged in a flattened triangle, with the two base lights about 10 degrees apart, the one apex light three digrees to the left and two degrees high.  If you connected the lights, it would have made a simple ship profile, with the bow to the left, the water line below. The lower to lights strobed simultanesouly, and when dark, the upper light strobed.  The rythem of the strobing would correspond to a normal resting heart beat of about 72 beats per minute.  These lights were stationary.  I opened the window and distinctly heard the great roaring sound emminating from their direction.  Using 7X35 binoculars, I could not make out any shape or outline, as the area between the lights blended in with the night sky.  The lights looked like typical aircraft strobes, but about twice as bright.  My wife also saw and heard this phenomenom. I observed the lights move, in unision, extremely slowly to the west  I watched for about 12 minutes before they dissapeared behind distant roof tops.  Just before this happened, the lights seemed to rotate slowly towards the north. I called the local radar tower and the tower at Cleveland Hopkins airport.  Neither had any craft on their radar in my vacinity, nor had there been.  I called the FAA the next morning to inquire about the same, and the woman there stated she had received a similar report from Huron, Ohio.  There, a man claimed the roaring had broken some windows.  Huron is due west of here.  Another friend living in Chagrin Falls Ohio, slightly south east of here, claimed to have seen and heard something similar the same night, glimpsing it through the tree tops surrounding his home. I am refiling this report because of the similarity to the Kalamazoo, Michagan sightings on the same night.  Kalamozoo is west by northwest of here.",

It passed almost directly over me &amp; continued in a straight westward line until the trees obscured it from view.  The light was like a motorcycle headlight - single, not double as an airplane's.  There was no accompanying jet noise or airplane motor noise - only a soft after\"hum\" - like a furnace running, or wind through trees.  This craft did not have red and green lights.  I saw 4 distinct lights arranged in a diamond shape (or a triangle with a tail).  There was also the suggestion of a few smaller lights around the back of the craft.  The front and rear lights were cream colored, while the side lights were amber and chartreuse.  It was travelling rapidly - from initial sighting to the point where I lost it in the trees took less than 30 seconds and the approximate distance I would estimate to be 3/4 mile.  The sky around my farm usually has many moving lights - all attached to regular aircraft.  The traveling speed of this craft astonished me, making me realize that it was not one of the \"regulars\".

I study dressage, ballet, spinning, weaving, and read in my spare time.  I hope that this report is clear and that the background info is what you wanted.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her to be a seemingly quite credible, sober-minded witness.  She reported that the object passed over her head, covering some 160 degrees (est.) of arc, in the 30 seconds she witnessed the object.  We do not believe that the object could have been a plane, in light of that fact.  The witness reported that it was totally silent.  PD",

At first we thought it was the beginning of a storm but the flash occured again though this time it had beams of light that shot out like spotlights.  The beams and light zipped thru the clouds and behind some trees.  We followed to see if a small plane had come down.  As we got closer we could see light illuminating thru the trees and we proceeded to exit the car.  As we got out of the car the lights lifted and rose above the tree line directly in front of us and then above us.  To our shock we saw a sphere like craft with white and red pulsating lights about the size of a garage.  We could make out from the light beams designs in the metal.  The craft paused above us then spun furiously and shot straight up into the clouds again and headed north.  We could see the lights still in the clouds as it ascended and left into the distance.  This was no military craft that we have ever seen before.  But with living near an airforce base we chose to believe maybe it was something experimental.  We took long stares at each other and were quiet on the way home.  The next day we decided not to discuss the matter openly and take our experimental aircraft explanation as the logical explanation, yet we all know what we saw and have yet to see any ship or craft like that so make of that what you will.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness has elected to remain anonymous.

The size of the craft was around 40 feet in diameter hovering about 200 feet above the house. It was emitting a loud, distorted noise that could have been music. It was spinning slightly and moving at about 25-35 mph. It was saucer shaped and had various lights around the vehicle. The time was around 3 to 5 o'clock in the day. After staring in awe for around 10 seconds, I ran to  the front porch thinking where I could find a camera inside. I decided that I would miss the opportunity to see the craft again and therefore turned to watch the craft float off into the distance. My Mother, Brother, and I all stared at each other in bewilderment. My conclusion after all these years is that the research on the 1965 'Abrocar' experiment in Nevada was not cancelled. From my research, the hovering vehicle was manufactured in somewhere in Nevada and flown and tested in an air force base in Canada. It is possible that we witnesses the experimental vehicle en route to the testing facility.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

My parents were gone camping and their neighbors to the right were on vacation, across the street were on vacation and the house to the left was empty, so the neighborbood was unusually dark and quiet.  I brought my clothes in the house and some other luggage through the back door, which is seldom used, because I wanted to a have a cigarrette on the back deck.  I brought everything through the back door and sat on the couch and turned the televsion on.  I sat their for a couple of minutes flipping through the channels when I realized that I was going to have a smoke.  I jumped up and quickly walked to back door which has a window beside it that faces the living room I was sitting in.  I opened the door, stepped out onto the deck, turned to my left, and saw something hovering about three feet away from me, apparently looking in the window.  It was a small, clear, long and thin object.  It kind of looked like a beaker with a yellow light in the center that had a steady, rythmic yellow flash and didn't make a sound.  When I saw it and it had seen me, it floated away from the window and a little closer to me.  I wanted to reach out and grab it, but I was a little scared.  Plus it kind of looked like it may be hot or even sharp or anything that could cause sever pain.  I hovered there and kind of checked me out for about 15 to 20 seconds, then slowly flew toward a large pine tree in our neighbors yard.  It looked like it was trying to hide from me behind the tree, but I could still see it's steadily blinking yellowish light through the branches.  Every once in a while it would come out from behind the tree a little ways, see me, then hide back behind the branches.  After a minute or so, it slowly rose into the sky.  It went higher and higher until I lost sight of it what seemed like about a mile up in ! the sky. After I stood and looked closer, I could see a yellow light flashing way the hell up in the sky and I thought it might be an airplane.  After a few seconds, however, it flew across the sky very, very fast, hovered up there for a while, then slowly lowered itself until it was on the other side of the neighbors house, exactly where they had window facing South.  After about 10 seconds, I saw it again hovering just over the neighbors house, then it slowly floated back off into the neighborhood and disappeared.  I went inside shut the windows, locked the doors and didn't leave until the next morning when I went up the mountain to tell my parents what I had seen.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Almost directly above me there was some type of aircraft.  From almost directly underneath, it had five rounded sides, with a light at each of the five points.  It was a bit like a pentagon, but rounded enough to say that it was round - with five distinct edges.  The lights were yellowish in color and not very bright.  The craft was low to the ground compared to the air traffic that we typically see in our area. There were intermittent clouds in the area, and the craft was moving slowly.  It was moving in pretty much a straight line to the east/northeast.  There was a large cloud in it's flight path, and as it disappeared behind the cloud, I stood there to watch it come out the other side.  Given it's speed and the size of the cloud, I expected to see it come out the other side relatively quickly.  When it did not, I looked around, and saw the craft now moving in a south/southeast direction, looking like it made a 90 degree turn when it was hidden by the cloud. I could not make out the color of the craft since it was night, but the lights were yellowish and they lit the craft enough to make the five sides clearly visible. I am a professional and student in the town of Charlottesville in my late 20's.  I've never seen anything like this before, and was not under the influence of any substances - it was a fascinating experience, and I hope I see it again sometime soon to get a better look!",

I stood and watched for as long as I was smoking, and I went inside and mentioned it to someone, they didn't think anything of it, and I went back out, the lights were gone. Its been on my mind all this time, cause it was right over my head. We were there for another week, and every night I would look for them, and they didn't come back.",

Ufo's play tag with each other.\n\r\nAt 10:30 pm on the 26th of november 1997 My feionce alerted me to a very bright diamond shaped object sitting just above the horizion. On a overcast but still night. After watching the object for a minute or two i went to get my video camera. We went outside and started to film the object, almost imeadietly as i started to film the object slowly started to more to my right until it dissapeared behind a hill in the distance. We both look ed at each other and thought it was a bit weird but proceeded back inside. At that point an object in almost the same position as the first one. A large object was sitting on the horizion with a smaller object aproaching from it's right side (my left side) passed right by the bigger object and stopped and then flared up to the same size as the the other object. Big! at that point they started to fly towards each other passing by each other, one of the objects stopped where the first one was sitting and the other object moved behind the hill and out of sight. The other object remained in position for minutes before leaving in the same direction as the previous two objects. As was stated in the video by my feionce and I we where surprised at what we had just witnessed. At that point out of the corner of my eye i saw an object coming towards us i called to ((name deleted)) and said look up and we saw what looked like two balls of light with a strobing red light flying right by us with no noise and no definable features apart from being two balls of light. No wings no tail no blinking and more importantly no noise. the object was low in the sky, infact so low that it passed behind a tree a about 25-30ft tall about 20 metres in front of me. As it passed by us and went in front of us it was a mirror image of itself. In other words no visable change just two balls of light with a strobing red light going from left to right. We lost sight of the object about two or so kilometers away going behind trees. at that point i think we both knew we were watching something we had never seen before. Around five os so minutes later a large oval shaped orange glowing light appeared on the horizion right where we had lost the object behind the trees, low in the sky but clearly visable the object stayed still for minutes when all of a sudden a small object seemed to fly write up into the bright oval object.The bright object then changed shape into two white lights seperated by a small gap but with no red light this time and was approached by another similar looking object which flew past and a minute or two later both objects seemed to fade out and were no longer visable. The time now was around 11.30pm 1 hour later. Quite a long exhibition what ever it was! The next day i telephoned Air services Australia the official people who monitor aircraft movement into and out of Sydney. Their Response was that there was only one plane in the area at the time a 747 which flew past the area at 10.30pm and into Sydney (Mascot) and asked if i wanted to persue the matter further at the time i was a little nervous and so no but i would like to no what it could have been. Their response was after a minute or so on hold was that \"it could have been police helicopters or rescue helicopters\". Well if this is true then i am convinced we would have heard them as we had one pass almost directly overhead at no more than 100 feet. the UFO Society of Austrailia has also looked at my tape as well as an astronomer at Sydney Observerty, Channel seven news here in Sydney not to mention my family and friends are all of the same opinion we have seen and video taped ufo's. They cannot at this time be identified. I would be only to happy to show you this and other footage i have and let you make your on mind up. However as i live in Australia we only have vhs. Can you view a tape of this format. Also i would like to add that we also observed and taped other objects in the imediate area of that first sighting for a period of three months with other eyewitness accounts. ((name deleted))",

We saw orange lights below the cloud cover in the northern sky. they would change in size and brilliance, wink out and once on blinked out then flashed once very brightly. they usually appeard to be stopped, but after they would blink out, a minute or so later they would show up in a different location. First the apparent movement was to the west, but a few minutes later when the lights reappeared they stayed on and moved to the east. We also noticed several blinking white pinpoints of light in the general area of the larger orange lights. These appeared as twinkling stars, except that they did not appear to be stationary, actually they were more random in their position. The Orange lights at their largest might have been about half the diameter of a dime held out at arms length. I estimate our distance from the objects to be about 1.5 - 2 miles. we watched from our car out on some country roads. We saw them from two close locations (about 50 yards appart), and got out of the car and watched them both times. Later we move to a location that I thought would be closer but we did not see them again. I have seen the same things before with my daughter in the same general area arount last Thanksgiving. I know several others who have seen and described the same things in the same general location.",

My father whom has been famously a non-believer his whole adult life, has recounted to me a truly disturbing story.  Although it was a couple years ago, I finally decided to report his story. My father works for a local steel company, he would leave for the day shift at approximately 0545H every day.  He took the same route every day. Since we live out side of the city he would travel a back country road off the highway.  When he turned onto this road he noticed up ahead that it appeared to be the sun rising beyond the bush area.  He travelled closer, approximately a mile up the road, over a railroad bypass.  When reaching the max height of the bypass he saw what a large saucer type object to his left.  It was about half a kilometre from him.  He pulled over to the side of the road and observed it.  It hovered above the trees.  Predominately red lights with blue and white also.  They did not flicker but were continueous.  He told me that it was about 200 feet long in length and approximately 50-80 feet in height.  He remarked to me about how he couldn't believe how big it was.  It was noiseless and there was no other actions other than the ones stated above.  He observed for about  half an hour.  The reason he knows this, he told me, was because he pulled into work at 5 minutes to 0700H.  He left before it did, so it is unknown how long it stayed. He didn't tell me at first, he relayed the story to my mother, whom told me.  I questioned him right away.  He has refused to speak to anyone about it for fear of ridicule.  He is afraid of being called \"crazy\".  He did not speak of it for a couple years, self-doubt was obviously taking its toll on him.  A week ago I asked him about it again and he gave me more detail, with vigor.  Unbeknownst to him I am relaying to you his story. I am my fathers judge of character.  This is a man that doesn't cheat on his tax returns, obeys all rules and is strictly honest.  I have always believed in the possibility of UFO's.  Now I KNOW there is UFO's.

It was a clear cloudless night, my field of vision either way would have been at least 40 miles in Southern and Nothern directions. The light travelled from South to North direction and moved over land paralel to the coastline. The light did not blink and took 3 minutes from first seeing it, to disappearing in Notherly direction. Depending on the distance from me, speed could not be determined. Yet if it had been moving overhead, it's speed would have been 80/3 = 23 miles per minute At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but because there were no flashing lights, it must have been something else. I phoned a friend who at the time was the night editor for a large newspaper. When I stated: I have seen something strange, his immediate reaction  was: \"did you see purple lights in the sky ?\" Needless to say I was astonished and asked: have you had more reports on this? He said: \"dozens of reports, but you are the only one from the West side of the country, all the other reports came from the East side close to the German border.

The reason I think they were UFO is because the way they changed flying direction. They could suddenly reverse their direction and the acceleration was just not possible for any know man-made machine. They looked like playing each other. UFOs lasted about two minutes. When I went inside to get a camrecorder and to record them, they were gone. however, as a scientist majored in Physics, I must admit those UFOs I saw could be lighting. But I never saw any lighting like that. So I thought it may be a good idea to share my experience with some experts. Hopefully, I am not the only that reported this in NJ.

I used to live about 2 miles south of nellis AFB (foe about ten years) and saw large night maneuvers such as he described...with as many as thirty aircraft, and supporting aircraft such as refuelers, AWACS type aircraft, and cargo planes taking off at late evening hours and returning a short time later. Of course, some of these instances may be simply explained as one group of pilots leaving for their homes, and another group timed to arrive shortly thereafter. I have also witnessed the \"winking lights\" scenario described, though only once and it was here in the Pahrump valley, anout fifteen years ago. I saw a similar glowing ball of orangeish light, above the mountain range that sperates Pahrump valley from Death Valley area, it pulsed a total of three times that I witnessed, and in those pulses it appeared to travel some twenty or so miles northward . I saw NO chase airxraft as the other gentlrman described, and had two witnesses with me. I at first argued that it must have been a series of beacons on radio relay towers or something, but there are no towers along that range. No sound, ball was about the size of a pencil eraser on end at arms length. It would start as an amber dim glow, increasing in intensity over about five seconds, then flash out and reappear some five miles uprange. Whew! All of that said, I only have one more thought to add before I tell about my sighting. Because of the job Ihave, I have occasion to drive seventy miles at night five nights a week, and have noticed that lights can easily be seen thirty miles or so most of the time, and aircraft lights approaching MCCarran can be easily seen 50 miles away. You would never hear them, but you would see them, and a more inexperienced viewer might feel they are much closer, and therefor should make noise. Also, I have seen flares dropped by evading aircraft, and the orange lights are NOT at all the same, flares slowly fall to earth, start brightly and then dim. Now to my sighting. Its about 9 PM, I am in a hurry to get inside to watch something on TV, and as I walk westward to my door, I hear a low throb in the air. There is a small helicopter service that sometimes flys at night here, and the air-rescue helicopters from Vegas, each with their distinct sounds, and it was neither. Sometimes jets heading to MCCarran will throttle back over the Pahrump valley and the change in pitch as it bounces of the mountain ranges, and its strange, so I pause for a moment in the dark, scanning the clear night sky for any unusual movements. About thirty seconds later a pair of red flashing lights appear over the range of mountains directly to my Northwest, the foot of the range is two miles from my home, and I beleive that the lights were two of the black helicopters stationed out at Nellis, you can usually see them at the extreme North end of the airstrip if you drive LVBL North to the Speedway racetrack. Anyway, these are the two prop jobs, which fits with my recollection of the sounds from Nellis when I lived there. The two lights followed the ridge of the mountain Northwest and at one point flew below the ridgeline, obscuring them from view and masking their sound almost completely. Since the Nellis training grounds lie mainly NE of the Pahrump valley, I can only guess what they were doing flying along the NW range of PV, unless it had some thing to do with sneaking into the training area by flying low and entering from the west instead of the south or southeast, as much traffic does. Well, that is all I have to say, and I am not a debunker or anything, but I have lived near airbases since I was 8 years old. I'm 40 now, and worked nights for the last six years. The report from Las Vegas seems to be a description of night manuevers, with planes chasing the Agressor aircraft, and larger planes supplying intel to the pilots, whose jobs are much more dangerous at night in a dogfight situation. The flashes could be flares, and the excersise could probably be seen if it was held in the southern end of the Nellis range and the subject lived on the side of \"sunrise\"(frenchman?) mountain, say near the intersection of Lake Mead and Hollywood, which affords an excellent view at night of Nellis AFB airstrip and views some forty miles northward. I would also guess that my helicopters were involved in a similar night action, perhaps practicing recovering a pilot downed at night. Sorry to go on so long, I just thought it would be fair to give a litlle explanation of the manuevers around Nellis AFB, since a lot of people would think military air traffic at night as strange, but at Nellis, its fairly commonplace!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We agree with the contibutor's assessment of lights in the night sky.  They can be very difficult to identify positively.  PD",

All I remember is looking to my right out the window and seeing a large disk-shaped object hovering approximately 50 feet in the air over the field.  I could only see the underside of the object,  but it was radiating a pink light which lit up the whole car.  I remember a very powerful vibrating humming sound which sent a numbing &amp; tingling sensation thru my body almost like what I imagine an electric shock would feel like.  I turned my head away from the object to look at my date saying, \"Oh my God...\" as I turned my head, and it felt like I was moving and speaking in slow-motion.  I remember nothing else except that I arrived home at approximately 1:30am,  and do not recall how I got home or what happened.  I never spoke of that night to anyone until about 5 years ago,  and I only told my mother and 2 of my closest friends.  Since that time I have ran into the person I was with,  but have never had the courage to ask him about that night,  because it sounds so crazy.  Since that time, I have experienced what a neurologist told me is probably a sleep disorder called sleep paralysis.  I will be on the verge of sleep,  but still aware of what is going on around me and I get a buzzing sound in my head,  which progressively gets louder and louder,  then what feels like an electric wave runs thru my body causing that same tingling &amp; numbness feeling that I experienced that night.  When this happens,  I am completely paralyzed,  then I don't remember anything else.  I either pass out or fall asleep or something.  This happened approximately every 3 months until the last year, during which time it seems to have stopped. I am very skeptical,  and have anylized this,  wondering if it really happened or if it was a dream, yet it is still so vivid &amp; such a strong sensation.  I am an educated person, am not delusional,  and am of very sound mind,  but yet when I sp! eak of w hat I saw,  it sounds crazy,  even to myself.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  We know nothing about sleep paralysis, although it frequently is cited as a source of suspected UFO abductions.

It was a very clear night - lots of stars, no moon. This is a very rural area and in the direction I was faceing (NE) there are very few ground lights. I at once noticed a very bright white light over a wooded ridge about 1/3 of a mile distant it was just at the tops of the trees and I could see the tops of a couple of pine trees in front of the lower half of the light. The light did not move and I could not imagion what it could be. After watching it for two to three minutes it suddenly decreased in intensity to about one tenth of its origional brilliance and remained at that level as I watched it for another several minutes. At this point I was getting very cold and went back in to bed (to sleepin bag). The next year, late in the Spring, I walked to the ridge which has a large clearing in front of it from logging. I found nothing at all to account for the light.

Approximately above Lake Washington, about the height of  traffic helicopters, I saw 3 lights moving East almost along the freeway.  They were moving steadily and seemingly average speed, but their shape was very long, with the apex of the triangle shape above 2 smaller white lights.  They appeared to be one object moving absolutely together.  I kept looking while I was driving, at first thinking it was a helicopter with smaller planes flying near it.  When I went around the overpass and looked back again, it had disappeared.  The top light was so bright, it almost blinded me.  It wasn't a blimp, a jet plane or a helicopter.  I was convinced I had seen a UFO and went to work as usual.  I told my coworker what I had thought, but did nothing else!

I went outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch.  I was sitting sideways to the road, the smoke from my cigarette seemed to be hovering in the air, I was in my own world and didnt notice for a couple of minutes.  When I turned to look up, it was not the smoke from my cigarette.  Right above tree top level, hovering directly across the street was a triangle shaped UFO .  I live in front of a subdivision and the triangle was at the entrance to the subdivision.  It did have smoke around it some and it started make a very loud noise like it was in trouble.  It hovered there quite some time.  I walked out into the yard and stood by my fence.  I could see directly underneath it then.  It had 4 lights that seemed to be in each corner of the triangle.  I know that sounds strange but standing underneath it, the triangle seemed to have four corners.  Like it was triangular on top and square underneath.  I know it doesnt seem to make sense but that is what I saw and Im not lying about it.  It just hovered even after I stood staring at it for what seemed a long time.  It was still making an awful racket.  I finally came to my senses and went and got my sister from in the house.  She came out and we both went and stood by the fence, the craft then oh so slowly began moving up the street, towards Old Stage Rd, going up the hill.  My sister and I walked with it down the side of our fenced yard.  It was still making a loud noise.  Later at a x-mas family get together, my aunt who lives down Old Stage Rd was talking about how a loud noise had woken her up at night a few days ago, she said it was making a terrible noise and she said it was around 1:30am.  So it must have kept traveling down that road.  Also my neighbor across the street came outside, stood underneath it looking up at it.  When the UFO started to move, he jumped in his car and followed it up the road.  My sister nor I ever spoke to him about this since we werent on speaking terms with him.

It was very slow moving, getting brighter and larger as it approached. I awaken my younger sister (16 at that time) and pulled her to the window. The object was a saucer shaped object with lights surrounding it (amber and green), with no sound at all. The window was open and it was a very still night. It moved directly over our house, was bigger than 2 houses put together and was very low in the sky. I ran out of the back door and stood on the steps and watched it moving directly toward the FAA on Kennedy Blvd. It was the slowest moving airborne object I have ever seen. I went back inside to call the FAA to notify them, dropped the phone and awakened my Father who would not go outside to see if he could see it. He sent me to bed...

Our location was about 10 miles SE of downtown Nashville, TN, at the Starwood Amphitheatre.  The time was 19:45.  Because of the angle of the sun and the height of the \"speck\", my first guess was that we were seeing a low-orbit satellite.  It was tracking WNW at an altitude of at least 100,000 feet. We had two sets of binoculars with us, so I watched it with 10x50's while my wife watched it with 8x35's.  It resembled a lollipop, of all things, with the round sphere brightly reflecting the sunlight and the \"stick\" end clearly rotating around its axis once every 4-5 seconds.  This was all pretty cool -- I had never been able to see one so clearly before. And then a strange thing happened: it appeared to \"explode\".  Right before our eyes, we watched this object, still tracking to the West, split up into several pieces.  The largest chunk emitted something like a cluster of BB's, in other words, where there was one object before, now there were two or more smaller objects and an array of tiny pieces, each reflecting the sunlight perfectly, fanning out toward the South.  The fan of BB's and the main object(s) continued tracking together, but gradually increased the distance between themselves.   A third piece moved rapidly away from the main group, at a faster velocity than the BB's, toward the SE. My first thoughts were that we had just witnessed some space junk disintegrating on re-entry, but the speed didn't seem excessive, and the movement of the third piece didn't seem to jive with the general motion of the main body.  The total elapsed time of viewing this thing before it was obscured by clouds was about 5 minutes.  In that time, it traversed maybe 10 degrees of overhead sky.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Emitted other objects, LandedBoomerang UFO sits on barn\n\r\nThis report was made by ISUR.  I would like to add additional info. that was not listed.  When first seeing the moving lights(several in the trees next to barn about 100ft away from me) I thought it was helicopters, but there was no sound. After opening the gate, I looked up the balls of light morphasized into a boomerang shaped craft and was sitting on top of my barn with wings overlapping both sides of the barn(150 ft wide)and just 15 ft above my head.  It was of unusual texture, almost like a shark, did not reflect light and was boomerang in shape. I was not afraid at all. The really strange part of the story was after opening the gate for my husband to drive in.(He always waits for me to close gate and get back in the car)This time he drove right passed me and did not stop. Somehow I got to the entrance of the barn before he did and was there when he got out of the car.(I can not get this point off of my mind and I wonder if we were abducted) There did seem to be some time lapse of 30 to 45 minutes.   We both watched the UFO disappear over the barn. It seemed to go invisable and we could see stars through it. Over a year later we were informed by ISUR that a neighbor(in his seventies) had seen so many lights over and around our barn that he had bought a Video Camero in hopes of video taping the lights.  This makes over 5 people other that my husband and myself that had seen ufo type objects over our farm. The following is the case study by ISUR At approx. 11:30 pm on a weekday evening during the first week of March 1997 (*there is some uncertainty as to the exact day), Mr. and Mrs. Doe (pseudonyms) were returning to their home, located east of the city of Canton, in unincorporated Cherokee County GA. The Does run a horse farm, utilizing a large industrial-type building (which they call a\"barn\") located some 200-300 feet off the highway. As they got up to the fence gate at the end of the driveway, Mrs. Doe noticed a large, lighted object up above and to the right, above some very tall pine trees. From the car, both witnesses then observed the object begin to descend, moving toward a position above their barn, in a series of jerky, stop-and-go motions. Mrs.Doe got out of the car to open the gate, and both continued to observe the object while Mr. Doe pulled the car forward to the front of the barn. The witnesses state that the object was hovering only a slight distance (perhaps 10-20 feet) above the barn. Meanwhile, Mrs. Doe walked forward to a point at the corner of the building, where she could clearly see the object directly above her. About the time Mr. Doe got out of the car, the object vanished. The two are not sure whether the disappearance was by \"blinking off like a lightbulb\" (Mr. Doe' impression), or by near-instantaneous acceleration and flying away (Mrs. Doe's impression). Total time of the sighting was estimated, with difficulty, as 3-5 minutes. The object was described as triangular or boomerang-shaped, and very dark, \"darker than shadow,\" \"darker than black.\" There was one \"dull red\" light at each (side) end of the object, while the other corner was unlit. It appeared to be as wide as the building (approximately 120 feet). Mr. Doe said that the area between the \"arms\" of the \"V\" was difficult to see and may have been either solid (making it a triangle) or not really filled in (making it more like a boomerang shape). Finally, even though the farm houses about 50 horses as well as geese, cats and dogs, both witnesses noted a total, complete silence throughout the event, a silence the witnesses felt was very strange. Mrs. Doe states that she was not going to report the sighting until a property developer working on a nearby parcel of land came to her home, introduced himself, and said that some men working for him had seen a football-field-sized object above the Doe's property. After the encounter described here, Mrs. Doe then found ISUR's website. An onsite interview and walk-through was conducted by ISUR investigator  and myself on 6/12/97. The two witness' accounts matched up well, although not perfectly, which does not support the idea of a preplanned deception. Mr. Doe could not verify his wife's first impression of a more-lighted object when she initially saw it, although he says that from the drivers' seat he was not in position to see it well. Driving onto the driveway at a later time, I judged that this makes sense; and also, I noted that the driveway lacks enough angle to put a car's headlights up enough to have struck an object hovering above the barn, so there is no logical discrepancy there. Mr. Doe is an amateur astronomer and states that he is very familiar with the night sky, and had recently spent considerable time viewing comet Hale-Bopp.\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>\"Mr. and Mrs. Doe\" appear to be pseudonyms.

There had been pretty high winds throughout the day and it would not have suprised me as we were on the 10th floor of the Rio Tower. Our room looked out over the back of Ceasars, and the Marage. Anyway,  I told my wife to look at it and she said it looks like a parachute coming down.  I jumped up to my feet and told my wife to hand me my glasses.  It appeared to be a parachute coming down with a wobble. I was unable to tell the size,  but it seemed to be about 2000 ft or so high.  Again,  I couldn't get a good idea of the size.  The closer it got the more it looked like it was the top of a mushroom or a jellyfish, without tenacles.  I then thought maybe a weather baloon.  I have an A&amp;P linense and have been in the Aviation industry since I was 18 in the U.S.A.F. and have worked on the flight line day and nighttime hours for the rest of my life working as a line mechanic. I don't feel that I get fooled easily by objects in the sky.  I have never seen anything that I thought couldn't be explained away before.  Now for what was unbelievable to me.  The object then stop decending and started to rise.  It continued to rise until it looked like a small star, it was very bright as it moved higher, then made a left turn and went a small ways to the left and then, get this! It completely reversed and started back the way it came. There were some clouds about, but my view was to a clear blue sky.  They object then began to climb at an angle and met with another object about the same size that came down from above it. They move together up and to the right until they disappeared from view. In the next few minutes, as I continued to watch the same area of the sky, I shaw three more decend,  but not nearly as close to the earth. They too started to climb  and change directions as they move out of my sight.  There were some large planes with contrail flying over,  but these objects had no contrail. ! Being i n the hotel room,  I was not able to here any sound. I am now 55 years old and I am glad that I have finally seen what I believe to be a sighting of a craft that was not from this Earth.  If it was from here, we really have some great stuff that we're not telling anyone about.  I think this pretty well covers what I swear I saw.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object7 UFOs flying in a train formation seen in Northfield MN, 1991\n\r\nI have created a Flash animation of this experience: http://www.((URL deleted))  In 1991 I was a senior at St. Olaf college in Northfield,MN. The following was witnessed by me, and at least 4 of my friends. The event occured in April or perhaps May of 1991. I was dark but it hadn't been dark very long. I'd guess it was 9:00. A group of us were in my friends apartment (Lincoln Parkway apartments) when one of my friends called us out to the second story balcony of the apartment. \"hey guys check this out.. are these UFO's or something?\" We went out of the desk and there were several lights about 40-45 degrees above the horizon (from our perspective).. These lights were moving fairly slowly in our general direction.. as them moved closes they seemed to be following each other, one after the other.. I would call it a \"string\" of lights..there were 7 or maybe 8 of them. I'm almost certain that these lights were moving independantly of each other and were not part of a single, huge object. The lights were a deep, amber red. I'm fairly certain the red lights were on continually and were bright. In addition, each \"craft\" also had what I remember to be several strobes blinking in a repeating, irregular, odd pattern not like the once every 3 second strobes of an airplane. the repeating strobe pattern (of maybe seven individual blinks) that each craft had repeated I would guess every second or so. I got the impression that these lights were fairly close to us.. and the size of each was maybe the size of a small plane. (20 feet diameter each?) I didn't notice any sounds from these lights. I actually got the cordless phone and called my roomate (who was in my apartment in the next building) and told him to go out on the balcony and look at what we were seeing.. I asked him what he thought they were and he said \"I don't know, a train??\" which was obviously not the case because trains don't fly, and these things were definitely in the air. But the lights were \"train like\" with one following the other  blinking their weird lights.  The distance between these lights in this string was not far. They seems to be much closer together than what I would think to be a safe distance. A couple years later I noticed a formation of helicopters flying, one after the other, and I took note that the distance between the helicopters was much farther apart than the lights that we say. Actually, I do remember that the noise of a train going by on nearby track was audible at the time. this may have also been what caused my friend to give \"train\" as an explaination. If there were any sound of the craft, the train noise may have gotten in the way of us hearing anything). But had it been 6 Cesnas that close, I'm certain I would have heard the engines. Still watching the lights, I called the police on the phone I was holding. the woman who answered said \"Oh, you know what those are? they're ultralight aircraft\". This I doubted. I had seen ultralight aircraft in the area before. But never to my knowledge at night, and never flying in formation. The crazy blinking pattern of these lights was unlike anything I had seen on any airplane before.  Seeing one of these things would have been curious, but It's possible that I may have just dismissed it as a plane that had odd lights but I doubt it. These lights were weird, and there were 6 or seven of them! Interestingly, the police-woman I was talking to told me that in a neary by town (Fairbault) there had been a newspaper story of some UFO sightings a week or so previous to the night I was talking to her. (more about this later). The lights continued closer and closer to us and seemed to get lower. Slowly, the lights drifted past us to our left and from our perspective they disappeared along the tree line. After the initial string of lights disappeard to our left, 3-5 minutes past and then we looked up and saw another single craft appear in the some location in the sky that the initial group appeared. It moves slowly along, following the path that the other lights took. I seem to remember this one being slightly different. I believe it was smaller, but perhaps it wasn't. It had similar red lights and blinking strobes. The entire sighting lasted about 8 minutes. I later regretted not getting out of the building and going out in the field past the trees to see if I could continue to see the lights, but to be honest, I was scared.  The next day I called the Fairbault newspaper and asked about the article that had been printed. The reporter verified that he had in fact written an article that discussed a couple of sightings in that area. I believe he mentioned that someone had seen a strange light shining a beam down or something like that. He also mentioned that a local farmer farmer had apparantly also had a sighting around the same time as us. This farmer had had sightings in years past and even had experienced cattle mutilations. The reported took my name and we talked about him possibly writing a new story talking about our sightings, but I didn't pursue it and neither did he so nothing ever happened. I also called the FAA and not surprisingly they weren't helpful. The 1997 \"Phoenix Lights\" reminded me somewhat of what we saw, how the lights appeared in a row. But the lights in that video seemed white, not red, and didn't appear to be moving.  The lights we saw were much closer to each other (and to us) than the lights in the Phoenix videos that were widely shown. I know this report lacks certain important information (exact time, date) but I've done the best I can. What I do know is that these were definitely, without question, intelligently controlled craft, not balls of light way off in the distance.  These lights were close and sharp and had it been daylight, I'm certain I could describe the shape of these craft, but it was just dark enough that we could only see the lights of the craft, not the shape of the crafts they were attached to. If these craft were man made, they were unlike anything any of the five of us ever recall seeing before or since. This string of lights was moving roughly in an east to west path.

They flashed simultaneously and flashed many colours like orange, green, blue, red and pink. I don't know how to describe that it wasn't a plane but let me assure you IT WASN'T. It moved at a fair speed though a bit slower than a plane i should think.

I read a report of a someone who saw something similar to what I have witnessed three different times in the French Quarter and the Central Business District of New Orleans.  The report I read said in 2/01, the witness only saw one black object slowly moving across the sky.  Every time I have seen these objects there were two in formation, casually crossing the sky, all three times I witnessed them at dusk.  They move very slowly in a direct path from NW to SE across the city.  The most dramatic sighting occured the first time...I was on my balcony, in the late afternoon, on St. Philip St. with my friend, when I noticed the objects moving across the sky.  At first I thought they might be birds flying from Lake Salvador to Pontchartrain, as there is always an increased amount of birds in the sky at nightfall.  I soon realized they weren't birds and I told my friend to check them out.  He got a little freaked out by them but we watched them slowly move across the sky.  About the time they  had reached the Eastern part of the city, and I estimate they were over or near Lake Ponchartrain, an incoming airliner apparantly swerved at the last minute to miss them, the sound of the jet's engines increasing as the plane veered to it's right and up to avoid the objects which just kept on their course.  We were pretty amazed at the whole thing. I have seen the objects twice since then, both times at sunset and both times they were flying on the same course over the city.  We have a lot of Military  bases near us in Mississippi and Florida, and we often get F-15s and even those warthog planes flying over.  I suspect it may be aircraft from a base because of the routine in flight pattern and time of day.  But whatever they are, they aren't using jet propulsion and they aren't prop-driven.  They are just black cyliners moving slowly  across the sky and are un-affected by the motion of the wind.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

So I took off my headphones and started to look at it...kinda spooked me out a first cause it wasnt making a noise and it was flying pretty low...Then I walked onto another street and then it started coming closer going towards the center of town, (Berlin) then as it went that direction I saw that it was sort of a cigar shaped object with no blinking lights just solid red and white lights...I was like forget it walked torwards my house and then I noticed another one comming from the same direction...I saw this person in a car and I asked them to stop and they were like \"What?\" it was a girl so she was kinda freaked out I was stopping her at 10:30 11:00 at night and I'm like look at that and she goes \"its a plane\" and I'm like \"NO!its something else I just saw another one.\" and she was like \"What are you smoking?\" and then i watched it go towards the same direction that was it. The second one had the same description 1) At first it looked like a glowing Diamond sort of thing 2)It had Solid red and white lights  3) they were kinda cigar shaped 4) both flying very low about what a helicopter would 5)they werent making a sound.

I thought at first they were radio antennas, but then was puzzled as I remembered my unit didn\u00b4t have any and certainly not placed on top the vehicle hangers. I stood for a moment, watching these sationary lights, trying to work out what they could be. Then to my alarm they appeared to move closer towards me (the distance between them closed very slowly). As I continued to stare at the lights they apeared to very slowly rotate around some sort of solid body between them although the lights appeared to remain sationary!There was no sound!(difficult to explain) As to what happened next I am unsure- I rememeber being extremely Scared( this was one of the few times in my life i was so scared AND I MEAN SCARED! thats why i can still remember it to this day.)I then remember walking back to my accomadation in the the early morning and I belive I then went to bed.

I can't recall what city she lived in.But she heard her dogs start barking then started jumping on the fence towards the north.It was about 12pm .She got up went out side to see what they was barking at. she looked around and saw a light above the the woods behind her house. it then dropped behind the mountians. she didnt think much of it.So she went back in side the dogs still barked for almost 30 mins after. a few days later she went in to town, and found out two campers went missing on the mountian she saw the light go behind. She told some people what she saw. but they didnt think it had anything to do with it. about week later around midnight the dogs started barking again trying to jump the fence again, towards the mountian. This time she stayed inside and looked for the light again.She saw the light again dropping behind the mountian. she stayed at the widow to see if she could see the come up again. about 20 mins later the light came up ,and took off towards the west. the next day my dad came home from work..he hauled stuff for a living. she told him what he saw and about the men missing.And how she thought it was a ufo.He laughed at her.But a few days later they went into town and read in the paper the men was found at their camp,with some kind of gliter stuff on their colths.and didnt know where they have been.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I thought that it was a satellite, rocket booster, or other misc. space junk crossing the sky, and continued to watch it as I have done in the past (I enjoy looking at the night sky and have 2 astronomy telescopes for viewing objects.) This is the strange part, the item made an instant course change and now headed due north (all directions are from my point of view). It then stopped at approx. were Auriga was. Let me say this also, everytime the item stopped moving, it would appear to be white, then before moving would start pulsing red, while moving it would remain red. All movements appeared to have instant top speed to instant stop, except for a few times were it would start at what I would estimate half speed. It then moved east and stopped to my north easterly position (around approx. the middle of draco.) Then stopped and went south, then it stopped again to my east south east position (between Bootes and Virgo.) Then it went westward, and stopped to my south (just below Leo) then make a few zig zag moves westward stopping between each movement and ending this near cancer. It then went north again, this Northward, Eastward, Southward, Westward movement, continued for at least 80 minutes (although it was now throwing in some go one direction and then go back  halfway). I watched this item also do an extremely fast and extremely tight circle (approx. the size of my fingernail at arms length) in the sky at which time it left like what appeared to be a fast evaporating contrail, (only the circle shape had the contrail). I continued to what until approx. 2350 hours. At which time I lost it over the horizon to the East.",

Saw a multi-light figure in Northern sky. Lights seems to change colors end to end, with white lights in the center. Object bobbed horrizontily and vertically, more prominately horrizontily. Was generally stationary but would move a few degrees left or right. Called for wife and daughter. Daughter ran back in scared,(16 year old). Soon noticed a second object, same as the first maybe 30 degrees East of first. First object moved quickly East, then settled back to stationary. Scanned more and saw two more, much more distant and in upper sky than first two. One of them moved towards the other, then settled into stationary. They then would fade, then come back later to near the same position. Got neighbors across the street, one is a deputy sheriff and observed from their yard. Discovered two more, one on horrizon, one in directly overhead position. Overhead object looked massive, lights were constant white, but it bobbed like the rest. Western most object disappeared, but came back a short time later. An aircraft passed the overhead object, only a blind pilot would not have seen this. Sparse, very thin clouds moved in, objects were far above clouds. Was able to tell that the objects were massive in size, especially the directly overhead one by the clouds and stars. Could clearly see the movements by putting an object in line with a roofline or tree limb. All of the objects were to the North and West of me with the exception of the more overhead object. This is in the direction of the Shreveport metro area. I viewed for 3 hours and finally went to bed. I made repeated attempts to call ufo hotlines with no success. I wanted to call the sheriff's dept. but my wife protested. I did have a deputy as a witness, so just as well. I tried to film, but my camcorder wouldn't pick the light up. I will look again tonight. I have lived here for 20 years and have seen nothing like this in my life. My with kept saying weather balloons, etc. I told her repeatedly that weather balloons don't bob and weave and have multi colored lights. Incredible experience, glad several of us witnessed the event.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have invited the witness to check the night sky on subsequent clear nights.

The first shows a contrail, but we have no way of knowing whether it was generated by the \"Aurora\" aircraft.  It may be nothing more than a normal contrail that has taken on a \"buttermilk\" appearance, which often happens in a slightly turbulent atmosphere.  Also, the second photo does appear to show two amorphous \"blobs,\" that appear to be somewhat triangular in shape.  Our computer monitor does not allow us to identify them, however.  We doubt that an Aurora aircraft would fly in formation with another, although that is a guess.  Also, if they were flying as low as the photo suggests they would be, they would be very loud to anyone on the ground, and they would be difficult to miss.  Our assumptions are predicated on the larger assumption that the \"Auora\" aircraft actually exists.  PD",

Here is my story: On the morning of January 31, 2001, as I was about to leave for work, something caught my attention in the sky that didn't look like anything that I was familiar with. As I observed for a few moments I realized it was definitely nothing conventional, so I ran back in the house, grabbed my Sony camcorder, and took an amazing video of several strange objects. There were two actual sightings that morning. The first sighting was of a single object that appeared circular with a highly reflective surface or blinking light, and possible rotation. Estimated altitude was above 10,000 feet. The object was in motion from west to east most of the time and blinking or reflecting sunlight at intervals, but did stop momentarily at one point, changed direction in a slow pace, hovered for several minutes, and then changed direction once again gaining altitude where it eventually disappeared behind a cloud. The second sighting occurred about 10 minutes after the first sighting ended. This sighting was of two different looking objects moving in tandem from north to south at a slow pace and appeared to have originated in the same general area of the sky where I lost sight of the first object. These objects appeared higher in altitude, possibly 20,000 feet or higher. The two objects were different in color from each other. Leading object was white with gray accents and some noteable structure, and the trailing object appeared black in color with a tinge of white reflection. At one point the leading object moves up and over the top of the trailing object and takes a position just behind it. After about 5 minutes I lose sight of them in the glare of the morning sun. After reviewing the tape I decided that it needed further study, so I sent a copy to Tom King for his expert opinion. His findings including stills and downloadable video clips of my footage can be accessed from his Skynet web site at www.ufovideo.com Later I sent a copy to Chris Miller of www.ufofootage.com. He was able to generate some great enhanced stills and video clips from the raw footage. One interesting characteristic of the first object that Chris discovered was a powerful light source emitting from the object. Only by slowing the footage down and viewing it frame by frame can you see a distinct blue to red color pattern of this light. I recently received a letter from Jeff Sainio of MUFON with results of his analysis of my video. His findings were inconclusive as he was unable to determine in any capacity what the objects are or are not. My story as well Chris Miller's comments and pictures on it can be viewed at: http://home1.gte.net/res0cs5f/ufo-1/ufo-1.htm\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>NUFORC rarely allows either names or URL addresses to appear in this portion of a report on our website, but we will make an exception in this case.

In fact it was the first night we were to stay here. Anyway, driving east I look out the passenger side window right beside me while my wife was driving and looking forward. I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing.  As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask \"What is that?\" We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this. To say the least this was the weirdest thing either of us have ever experienced.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness indicates a date of 03AP01, but subsequent investigation report suggests a date of 01AP01.  We have amended the date here, until we receive confirmation.  Please see report for same date by Minnesota MUFON.  PD",

Then the Disk Vanished.\n\r\nWhile headed for the University, I was driving with my Grandmother when I noticed what appeared to be a car in the ditch of Highway 840. The color was a sort of brownish blue Maybe a teal purple or brown also, and I could see only what I thought was the roof of the car and I saw the sun shining off it. As we rounded the road that ran along side 840, I wanted to see if it was a state troopers car. As our car got closer to the object, I noticed that it was not a car. It was a perfect Disk. About 2-3 feet round. It was doing nothing at all. As I watched, I thought it began moving along the ground. But before I could get some sense of its direction. It vanished. There was no noise, no flash of light. It just vanished. I asked my Grandmother if she had seen the disk and she said no . I then thought maybe I did not see what I had seen, but then I remembered that I had thought at first it was a car in the ditch. There was moderate traffic on 840 highway. But at the angle the object was laying it would had been hard to see it from that road. Only from my road could you see it. Our car was the only one on the road we were on. After it \"Vanished\" I looked again to see if there was a car there and there was nothing there at all. I did not go over to the express way to see if it left anything behind. I am unnerved by this. I am having a hard time believing that I actually saw it. The only thing I know is at first I thought it was a car in the ditch. THE OBJECT: It was about 2-3 feet in diameter or long. It was about a foot high. and It was a perfect disk. There was no sign of life in the short 2-3 minutes the event took place in. The person who is reporting this (ME) Is very un-nerved. I truely want to believe it did not exist but I saw it. There was no time lost. and I arrived on time to the University.",

After observing the aircraft for about 15 seconds I saw two small round dull red lights, many hundreds of yards apart, appeared over the airplane at 45 degrees above the horizon. The two red lights moved perfectly in unison, first moving away from each other, then almost converging and finally travelling at their original spacing before disappearing near tree top level to the West. The two red lights had a unique deep dull red hue which did not change in color or intensity. The lights movements through the sky approximated the shape of an hour glass. No noise was heard from the lights. The two red lights were visible for 10 seconds. After the red lights disappeared the landing lights from the plane (helicopter?) switched off and the aircraft disappeared into the evening sky.",

We will request additional information from the brother of the witness.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Aura or haze around objectGlowing orange flying saucer above UW Oshkosh seen\n\r\nI wanted some fresh air to clear my head, I'm up on the UW Oshkosh campus. I was in Donner Hall. Outside the window was a parking lot and to the left of that was a grass and a bench under a tree. I went outside and layed down on the bench so my feets were towards the building. It was nice. I was staring up through the tree branches (no leaves). From my view an orange clowing like thing came from the left. I saw it and fallowed it through the tree branches wondering what it was. It came out into the clear and it looked like a saucer, just like I see in the movies sort of and it was glowing orange, but it was clear enough to make out and see little ovals that might've been windows. It was a saucer bottom and a little hump in the middle (the way people say they usually look). There was only one and I was the only one that saw this I'm pretty sure. Suddenly as t continued going it did a spiral manuver (flying in a spiral) and disappeared from my sight behind the building (I don't mean it landed). It took me a few minutes to finally realize what I saw. But I DID see it. I told my now ex-girlfriend and my........about it. My girlffriend believed me of course (they believe you all the time), but my......didn't quite believe me. I had some exams that week and I'm attention starved and stuff like that. He tried to convince me that those were the reasons I saw what I saw. In the first place, I wasn't stressed at all. I had a lot on my mind and I did not do this for attention. No way. I can't be 100% sure of what I saw, but I god a damn good look and I saw and didn't imagine it. You don't imagine a glowing orange thing flying over you in the shape of a UFO. I didn't see any scifi movies or anything. It came out of the blue and wasn't even thinking of anythig realated. Sorry this is a late report, but better late than never. I feel kind of special that I saw a UFO.",

As I approached town, I noticed that these lights were coming from the grocery store parking lot area. It was a stationary object so even though it was about 2 miles to town it was still there when I arrived. I saw a dark triangle shape against the sky with the 3 lights coming from each side of the point witch was pointed towards the ground. I was curious, still thinking that this could be a hot air balloon or something else. I was the only car which turned into the parking lot. I thought this in itself was amazing since the road had alot of traffic that night. Was I the only one who saw this?. I pulled my car directly under the craft, which was only slightly above the parking lot light. It was a dark color maybe black, metalic with slight bumps arranged in possible adhesion or rivet type patterns. The shape was clearly up-side down pyramidal and about 50-60 feet from top corner to top corner. It was centered over 4 parking lot lights and I wondered if it was gathering energy from them also. It made no sound.(I turned off my car, and listened carefully between the waves of cars on the road). Another car pulled up, a grey Toyota Celica with 2 young men inside. they roled down their window and were looking at the craft with the biggest eyes I've ever seen. Their mouths were hanging open and I could see their tongues. I waved at them and the craft began to rotate on axis. The men burned rubber out of there and squealed tires again acelerating onto the road. I decided that my car was a safer vantage point at this time and hoped it would start. It did and I backed up about 50ft. The craft then headed towards the grocery store. It looked like it would run into the sign and roof. When the point of the craft got within 15-20 ft of the store, the craft lifted about 5 foot and cleared the store top. I should metion that it didn't make any sound, the lights had rotate! d from p ointing west to pointing south and it was only traviling at a speed of about 5MPH. Against the night sky I could see the flat top clearly. A few months later a co-worker was talking about the UFO that crossed the road in front of her. She said that she and others stopped their vehicles on highway 34 towards Greeley and just watched this up-side down pyamid thing cross the road. She said that it was still moving at about 5MPH. Her sighting lasted about 15-20minutes as she saw the lights before it crossed the road.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness does not specify whether the time was am or pm, but we presume it was a nighttime sighting.

There were only two of us  in a cube truck, I was the passenger. There were no other cars on the highway and it was a very clear night, when suddenly the interior of the truck light up with flickering fire light, we thought the trucks cube with all our supplies was on fire. The light source was on the passenger side (my side) just out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked the light was gone. We both saw the light, but didn't know where it came from. We were a little taken aback. Five minutes later the light came back on the same side as before, but it was much dimmer and again when we looked back in the mirrors the light disappeared, but it was the same flickering light and there was no other traffic on the road with us. We arrived at our destination and told others our story. It turned out that the same light flashed two others in a different car, the same night, but in their story it was much brighter and scared them so bad that they pulled over and camped the rest of the night. Three weeks later after the contract was finished the crew was going back to Prince George along the same road, this time I was sitting behind the driver, it was about the same time as before, but in a different truck and again there was no other traffic on the road and it was a very clear night. Suddenly I got a savear head acke, it was instant and painful, like someone was going into my head and trying to comunicate. I tried to hear, but failed. I was going to give up trying when I heard in the back of my head \"he still can't hear us\", with that I tried again to comunicate, but again could not make the connection. After about 15 minutes of trying I gave up and looked out the window to my right, past two of my crew. They were looking and talking towards the inside of the truck, so they didn't see what I saw. It was as large as a big marbell and bright white with a tail shooting out the back. Between the body and the tail was a gap about an inch wide. The spray was emmitting from the body and looked to be bubbling (large bubbles close to the boby and smaller ones at the end of the spray).From the spray shoot the tail which looked to be about five feet long. All the spray and the tail were orangy yellow in colour. The truck was going about ninty kms and when I looked at it, it slowed right down and flew behind the truck. The window it was flying beside was open a crack and when it slowed down and went behind the truck the noise from the wind coming through the window dropped by half, and my headacke went away instantly. I didn't say anything to my crew, I think I was in mild shock. Love to have it happen again. Next time I will stop the truck.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Time and date are approximate.  PD",

I pulled in my drive way and the white light globe lowered itself but was about 3 miles away from me and it hoovered again and the white light turned red.  It stood there for a few seconds then started west and the red light began flashing really really fast like a strobe light and it just vanished.  I live outside of town with few light and I could hear dogs all over town barking soon as the light vanished all the dogs stopped barking.  Two days ago at about the same time I was watching tv when my entire house started shaking very faintly though enough that my candles in the window seal where vibrating off the window.

In the early morning of April 13th, around 4:00 AM, on the from Paradise Beach on the Greek Island of Mykonos, two of my friends and I saw a strange orange light in the sky. My friends saw it exclaiming that they saw a shooting star. I looked up quickly expecting it already to be gone but it wasnt. It moved near the speed of a shooting star across the sky, which was very large given our location, above us. Then, about halfway across the sky it did something absolutely bizarre, it began zigzagging to the left and right at sharp, but seemingly identical, angles at the same high speeds as it crossed the sky. The whole thing might have taken eight seconds, but this thing definitely made about 10 radically sharp zig and zags before it vanished. I know of planes that could have crossed a sky that size in even less time, however, I know of know plane that can or would move like this. It had an orangish-yellow glow.

Four other people who were walking at the side of the road also stopped to comment on the strange sighting and continued on their way.  Several minutes passed and the object shot up into the sky at a tremendous speed without warning and out of sight within seconds.

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Emitted other objectsDisk, super fast, very low, completely silent.\n\r\nAt this time i was between 17/18 years old and living with my parents. My best friend was staying over for the night. Him and i went out at around 3am to go swimming at the club house swimming pool. (Yes it was closed, but we would jump the fence and swim anyway...i paid dues for the right to swim so i was going to do it when i wished.) As we came about two hundred yeards for the pool fence, we saw a large streak of light go across the sky, similar to a comet type firework. The color was green, like green flames, so we though someone shot a firework of some sort that did not make any kind of report. (Report as in sound) (I am not saying this is related to the craft to come, however a link is possible, even though i cannot say that there is in fact a link between them.) I do not know how long my best friend and i had been swimming before leaving, i would estimate an hour. We were talking in detail about many things like friends do, and we decided to stay outside until we had finished talking. My parents room was right above mine, and talking in a normal voice is easily heard from their room. So, we sat on my car in the drive way and continued our convercation. Now, i began to notice what i thought was a street light being obstructed by something else out of my peripheral vision. Like trees blowing and disrupting the light. However, i took note that there was no wind blowing, and so not enough to move any tree branches. So then i started looking to see what it was that was blocking the light at times. When i began to focus on the light, i then realize it was not a street light to begin with....and the source of this light was moving. (Coming at us.) I will not post my exact words, i said something to the effect of, \"What is the world is that?\" My best friend and i walked to the middle of the drive way to get under this objects flight path, or as close as we could guesstimate. It was at this point we got an idea of how fast this object was moving. I have no frame of reference, so i cannot tell you how fast it was moving. I have never been to an air show and have not seen a fighter jet make a low level, high speed pass. This craft was flying about 100 feet off the ground. As it came closer, i noticed the light source was a large tube coming from the bottom of the craft, and it was a clear tube. The light itself was amber in color, and it illuminated the bottom of the craft. The tube was about one third the size of the bottom of the craft, and the tube was located in the center. The illumination was not a brilliant light, it was dull, just like what you would expect from a street light at a distance in the color amber. You could clearly see the tube as being clear, and the light contained with it. I have no idea what material the craft was made of, other than to say it looked dark from the illumination of the amber light. I saw nothing but the tube and what it illuminated because the tube was my main focus. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was moving at a very fast rate, and from the time we took real notice and moved up the drive way all took about one minute. This craft made no audible sound....not even a whisper. And the craft was about the size of...i am having trouble relating its size.....if you were to cross two streched limousines . (make a cross of them) As it went over us and past my house, my best friend and i ran to the back of my house and up the balcony in the back to watch it for as long as we could before it went out of sight. When i first realized it was a craft, a craft i believed to be alien, my first impulse was to run back to my car and jump under it. Hey i am not ashamed to admit it scared me. During the whole encounter, neither friend nor myself spoke a word after we saw what the craft was. Both of us were in shock, and we did not speak for around 5 minutes after the craft had been gone. When we went into my house, we both took note that it was 5:50am. The pool was only about a 10 minute walk away. I do not claim anything happend other than what i just reported. I do not believe anything other than that happend. I cannot account for that large time loss, although as i said, i do not know how long we were swimming, nor do i know how long we talked on my car. The green streak was moving from the North West heading South East. The craft was moving east to west. I do not know if they were connected as said before, but i do not deny the possibility.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

As there aint alot to look at in my back yard I started to look up at the stars and to find constellations like the Southern cross etc. As I was looking in a ssw direction at approx 45degrees I noticed a flash 10-15degrees below where I was looking. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I noticed the flash in my peripheral vision, but as I looked at the spot where the flash occurred I saw another flash in around the same place. This second flash occurred maybe 15secs after the first and was the shape/size/colour of a bright star. Then as I was pondering what it was that I saw, I saw another flash exactly the same as the second and then another following 2-3secs after. Then as my mind started racing to explain this flashing I saw a smaller dimmer object the size/shape/colour of a faint star appear a thumbs width to the left of where the flashes ocurred moving diagonally down to the right at about a 30-35 dgree angle and then disappear just after it crossed the up/down 90degree angle line of where the flashes ocurred. The smaller, dimmer, moving object moved the distance of 1 and a 1/2-2 thumb widths alltogether and this took around the time it takes to say \"one\". I could not see any shape to these objects as they must have been too far away. After realizing what I'd seen was most definately a U.F.O. I became very excited and ran inside to get a flashlight to signal back as it seemed \"they\" might have been using morse code, but this was in vain as I did not see anything else unusual that night.",

At approximately 1:15 am we noticed a very low and slow flying object approaching from the south.  It sounded very strange emitting an low electric humming sound changing in pitch.  As is approached the sound increased in intensity but was then also accompanied by a jet engine sound. Not a jet engine in flight, but a jet engine idling. As the first approached we noticed a second craft in the distance coming from the same direction.  The first craft passed almost directly overhead and was probably less then 500 feet off the ground and flying slower then 100 mph, probably slower! Slower then any aircraft i've ever seen.  I've lived near an airport all my life so i know what planes and helicopters look like.  This didn't fit either description.  I saw 4 or 5 whitesh yellowish lights. Some of the lights appeared to be spinning to me,  but my friend could not recall them spinning.  The lights looked like standard aircraft lights, but the position of these lights on the craft looked strange. I could not make out the shape of the craft.  Though the most noticable thing about it was the strange noise it was making and it seemed to float across the sky rather then fly. After the first craft flew overhead, a second followed about 30 to 45 seconds behind. On this craft we could only see 1 light of the same white yellowish color.  It too was flying very slow and directly overhead in the same direction.  Though i don't think it was making the same strange hum the first object was.  It sounded like a jet but was flying way too slow.  And it did not sound like a helicopter. No strange electric or magnetic effects were objerved.  My guess is its probably ours, a craft which still uses conventional jet engines while also having some anti-gravitic technology integrated in. Could this account for the jet-engine sound and the strange loud humming noise?",

From a distance away I could see something up ahead that I had never seen before.  I traveled that road every day. That particular day I stayed later for a meeting.  As I came upon the circle which connects Route 1 and Route 130 in North Bruswick, there was a HUGH circular craft hovering over the circle. It was HUGH, the size of a city block.  It made no sound, just hovered.  It had colorful lights on the bottom.  I pulled alongside the highway near what use to be the NJ Boys Scouts Headquarter and just sat and gawked at it.  Many people had parked along the highway to observe.  I left before it did.  I wanted to rush home to bring back a family member to see it but no one believed me when I told them about it.  I never went back.  Since that date I make it a point of watching the Discovery channel or History channel or whatever show has to do with UFO's in the hope that I'll see a story about that incident but I never have. It is now 2001 and I still think about that event.  It was a beautiful sight which did not frighten me.  I would like to read reports in this database from other people that saw what I saw.\n\r\n((ADDENDUM #1))\n\r\nCleary, I was having an  off day.  In my report, please correct HUGH to HUGE and in the description of the craft, you might want to replace the CIRCLE description with the word DISK.  I thought more about it last night and the word DISK better describes  the craft.  Thank you \n\r\n((ADDENDUM #2))\n\r\n((QUERY BY NUFORC REGARDING DATE OF SIGHTING))\n\r\nDear Ms. ((name deleted)),\n\r\nThank you for the wonderful report.  I suspect the incident may have gained some publicity in local papers, but that is only a guess.\n\r\nThere is a celebrated case in which a strange craft allegedly fired a \"beam of light\" and shattered a window in a building in Bergen County (??), NJ, but I do not remember the date.  It allegedly occurred in a building that was located somewhere near where Meadow Lands Sports Stadium currently sits.\n\r\nAlso, if you can ever \"reconstruct\" the date of your sighting, please let us know.  We know from experience that people often can come within a week or month, if they sit and think about what they were doing at the time, why they were driving, what car they had or what clothing they were wearing, etc..  In addition, fuel receipts, cancelled checks, credit card entries, etc., are all very helpful in this respect.\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to share the sighting with our Center!\n\r\nCordially,\n\r\nPeter Davenport\n\r\n((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nFor the sake of argument, use tHe 4/79 date.  I would like to see my report entered into the database just because it  may spark the interest of one of the other people that  was also parked along the highway.  That person may end up having a more accurate fix on the exact date.  Believe me I have tried to reconstruct that day in my mind for what seems like an eternity.  I know the date is a vital link.  Normally, I have a good memory but for some reason that exact date escapes me.  I presume you have already read the report I submitted.  Isn't that why you just contacted me?     I know this is really going to top off the cake but the closest picture I have ever come across which resembles what I saw is one fleeting moment of a spaceship in the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"  Not the aircraft where they communicate back and forth with sounds but earlier in the picture. If I could get a picture of the craft used in that movie, I could pinpoint exactly what I saw looked like.  The one in the movie didn't stay on the screen for long but when I saw it, I almost jumped out of my skin.  Even to this day, it is the only picture I've ever seen that most closely remsembles what I saw.  ((name deleted))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

As I was getting out of bed to get her something to drink, I heard what seemed like a strong gust of wind banging the shutters against the house very loudly. As I approached the window to see if it had been raining, a light of some sort, so blinding, appeared out of the darkness. The windows then violently thrashed open and I went completely paralyzed. All I could hear was what sounded like a thousand sirens ringing and my wife screaming in the background. All of a sudden I began to levitate. My wife had also been paralyzed and was floating, in midair right next to me. I cant remember what happened from that point on but when I came to, I found me and my wife outside, in the middle of our yard. When I looked over at my wife I could see she wsas screaming but I couldn't hear anything coming out. All of a sudden there was a complete silence, and let me tell you, I remember to this day that I have never heard a silence as silent as it was at that moment. Next thing we knew we were transported by a beam of light into what seemed like complete darkness. I couldn't see my wife, I couldn't feel my body, and I didn't know wether I was floating or strapped down. But I could feel this pressure, this invsible force, that was compressing my lungs to the point where I couldn't even breathe another breath. When I tried to scream, nothing came out, I didn't even know if I was breathing anymore. I began to hear my wife gasping for air and once I could hear her, the pressure got stronger and I tried to take a deep breath but inhaled nothing but some sort of fluid that filled my lungs so much I could feel my skin burning as if it was tearing off my body. It was then I began to hear my wife screaming the most awful, horrifying screams and I could do nothing for her. I began to weep as a sharp pain engulfed my entire body. It almost felt as if someone carved from the bottom of my legs through my spine, and up! my body with a dull knife. I have never felt pain so terrible in all my life. I passed out for what seemed like eternity. As I regained consciousness, I'm sure I saw my wife standing in front of me, and it seemed like she was reaching to embrace me, but when I tried to reach out for her, it felt like I had been thrown back and slammed into a brick wall which turned out to be the ground in my yard. I looked over and saw my wife laying next to me motionless. All the pain was gone and I looked over again to see my wife turning. I got up as if I was never even touched or moved or thrown around. I went over to help my wife up, and as I saw the expression on her face, everything inside of me burst  because I knew that they had taken her from me forever. My wife died that night and to this day everyone believes that she passed in her sleep because the coroner could find no trace of injury and no sign of trauma that could have caused her to die. I never told this story to anyone.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I was then warned by these doctors that I should never speak of them or else I could be in great danger.  The treatments continued for a while then finally just stopped.

I was about 5 miles from the toll booth and it took about 5 minutes for the object to intersect my truck at the zenith (toll both). I paid my toll, went down about 1/2 mile and pulled off to the shoulder of the road. It was very, very low and the far left light had a single red strobe. My wife got out and we measured this object with our outstretched arms. It was very huge and covered the distance of about 5 normal sized human hands. Almost like looking at a 747 a couple of hundred feet above the tarmac at an airport. This object made no engine noise. No turbines, no prop, no nothing. To be honest, I was completely amazed at the lack of engine noise. This object was triangle-shaped. Similar to a boomarang but with well-defined sharp corners. We stood there about 2 minutes as it slowly drifted a couple more degrees southest and while still directly above us; accelerating and gaining altitude rapidly past the horizon in about 15 seconds. By the time we were able to get the camera and snap a picture it was too far away to get anything of use on the film. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The city of Louisville had its annual \"Thunder over Louisville\" that same night so this event may be related to the airshow. But I never saw any aircraft that low that didn't make an engine thrust sound or traverse 90 degrees of sky in 15 seconds. If anyone saw the same object, I wish they would post it here so as to compare notes; or confirm that it wasn't an illusion.",

I was lying in my hot tub and gazing up at the night sky. Suddenly a flight of 6 objects flying in a east by north east direction (approximate heading 080) at a fairly high rate of speed appeared at about 70 degrees azimuth to me. I live on the coastline, so the craft were coming in from over the ocean. No idea of altitude, but high enough where I could not see any detail on the craft. All craft appeared to be exactly the same. The craft gave off a faint whitish glow (a slight cast of yellow), just enought to make them visible. The craft were in perfect separation. After passing overhead, three of the craft broke off and changed heading to approx. 070. The other three maintained course for approx. 1-2 seconds, then joined up on the first three. Perfect separation was maintained at all times. No sound was heard. The craft dissappeared several seconds later, still headed approx. 070. At first I thought they were birds, then jets, since I used to fly jets in the service (A-4's). What got me was the sudden brake off movement of the first three, with no roll movement observed when they changed course. They seemed to simply \"translate\" over, for want of a better word. Also the speed seemed very high, and the separation was too perfect. I have seen many flight demonstration teams, but nothing like that. Flying that type of perfect formation would be very difficult for a military jet. Also, some sort of roll movement is required to change heading that quickly. Very strange.",

On the extruding side, it had small green lights on each end, but i have been familiar with only red ones on a plane, but never in pairs. The wierd thing the two of us noticed was that from its low altitude, it was not making the slightest noise. Our town was quiet as could be at 3:40 AM also. Another wierd thing about the craft, was that it was hoovering, not as much flying. It was late, neither one of us were drastically tired, intoxicated, nor had any drugs in our bodies and are truthfull behind what we saw.

There were approx 16 lights/fireballs that were twisting and turning in 2 parallel lines that resembled a BI Plane.  The size was massive and as the lights spun around, they emitted a white flame with orange red smoke.  Some cars on the freeway pulled over but I was too mesmerized and stunned. They were slow moving and were visable for at least 3 minutes.  After they had passed, I drove through a magenta fog for approximately 1 mile.  It was beyond comprehension.  2 and half hours after the sighting, I experienced severe stomach cramps which resulted in projectile vomit of ten feet.

We went to this path by our house.  It had a slope on it and it was a nice spot for kids to go sledding.  My neighbor and I were doing just that when all of a sudden I look up and see what I thought was a comet.  I said to my friend, \"Hey look!  Check out that comet!\"  We both look at it for a few seconds.  Then he notices another similar \"comet\" to the north of the one I saw.  My first reaction was, \"Maybe this is a meteor shower,\" but I soon realised if this was a meteor shower why weren't the meteors visually moving.  I looked back at the UFO I spotted and saw that it had moved further up (it was on an angle like this \\ from our viewpoint) and the tail had grown.  Then one of us saw a third UFO in the distance which was about 1/2 inch long at arm's length ( the first was about 1 1/2 inch and the second 1 inch ) I can't recall exactly what happened because we were both so excited, but #2 had grown and moved, too.  Eventually the third one moved and a fourth appeared.  Let me remind you that I didn't see any of these moving, growing, or appearing.  This kept on happening, one would move and grow while another would appear.  After about a half an hour there were nine UFOs and by this time #1 had grown to about 4 or 5 inches and had moved so it almost vertical ( they were moving in a circular pattern with one appearing when it was horizontal and increasing in angle from there ) as the others had grown proportionatly.  By this time we were both freaked out.  So we ran the half block home thinking aliens were going to abduct us knowing only what the media had told us about UFOs and aliens.  After that I became very interested in the UFO phnomenon and read countless books on the subject.  My neighbor however, I think has pretty much brushed it off as somthing explainable, but I checked and there was no comet or meteor shower that night.",

The project we were on was over budget and we didn't want to stay another night in Kingman.  We worked until about 8pm and then hit the road.  My partner was driving.  I had my feet up on the dash of the passenger seat in our work van.  Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a very intense light orange colored light in the sky.  The light was about 10000  to 15000 ft in the air (approximately) and was shaped like a circle.  At first glance I thought it was a flare, but it had no light tracer and it held its position in the sky.  Then as that light faded, another appeared directly below it, faded, and another below it.  In what appeared to be a perfectly straight line. Then another light appeared to the right of the bottom most light in the vertical line, faded and then another light appeared and then faded.  It seemed to form an \"L\" shaped pattern in the sky.  My partner and I convinced each other that it was just something strange and unexplainable but not extraterrestrial.  We were in a hurry to get back to Phoenix traveling at about 85 mph.  About 5 minutes down the road from the first sighting, We saw another light exactly the same as what we had just witnessed.  This time the lights were more spuratic and didn't appear to form any particular shape.  The lights also appeared and faded the same as in the first sighting. There must have been about 5 more light appearances for a total of 11.  I remembered the sightings in Phoenix a couple of years ago that made the news.  I remember being very skeptical about the sightings then, now I am a firm believer.  This obeject(s) I witnessed was exactly what was described over the city of Phoenix.  another note: my first thought  was that it was lights reflecting off of clouds or something to that affect but then I took a look out my side window and found not a single cloud in the sky.

My experience began as I left a friend's house early one morning.  I drove to the end of his driveway, stopping to look each way.  The road, Pekin, is dark and deserted, with scattered homes and small farms on each side.  As I looked to my left, a line of brightly colored lights rose above the treetops 100 yards away and stopped in mid air. There were six lights, flashing on and off similar to a moving sign, or what you might see on a tiny portion of the Goodyear blimp.  They flashed red, green and white as they moved, from left to right.  I rolled down my window, expecting sound, but there was none.  Extending my arm out the window, and using my left index finger as a gauge, I noted that the line of lights were as long as my finger, from tip to palm, and that they were about half the thickness of the finger in diameter.  Puzzled, and not really sure what I was seeing, I just turned left as I always did, going east on Pekin.  As I started down the road, the lights moved to their left and crossed over the road from my right just as I passed under them.  I remember looking up through my windshield to see them, then they dissapeared behind trees as I drove on. A half mile down the road, there is a stop sign for Sperry road, where I would turn right.  I wondered what the blimp was doing out here so late, it's too rural for the blimp, so what was it?  I was now approaching the stop sign, and that's when I saw the lights come back from my left and stoped, hovering over the road at the same altitude directly in front of me and out about 200 feet.  I had the impression \"it\" expected me to continue through the stop sign and towards it.  My hair stood on end when I realized what these lights were, and I quickly turned right and sped off as fast as I could.  Looking left, I saw the lights were pacing my car at the same speed, at which point I became very frightened, shouting \"Not tonight, not tonight!\" Within a mile of that intersection, I lost sight of the lights, continuing on to Mayfield road, where I stopped and go out to look back.  In the distance, at least a mile back, I could see the lights hovering, still flashing their colors, at about 600 feet, I would guess.  Since then, I have interviewed four differnt persons of different ages, from 13 to 65, who have seen this craft in the same area.  In addition, Tim Good's book, Above Top Secret, contains a piece concerning a man who lived 30 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio, who observed a UFO on the ground for 20 minutes.  This location is exactly 30 miles east of cleveland, and the gentleman named in the book lives on the same road.  There is a lot of activity in this area, and it should be investigated.",

Out to the west I saw what appeared to be a large bird which I assumed at first to be a soaring eagle.  I watched it glide for a few seconds before deciding it must be a guy hang gliding.  It was below the skyline of the mountains.  It was to the west of our home.  What I assumed to be a hang glider because of its shape and proximity to the mountains was earth-toned, brown, beige and white.  However, these colors seem inadequate in describing the colors I saw at first.  As I continued to watch what then appeared to be a hang glider swoop side to side dipping and circling it then began to spin and rise flopping end over end. Then, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, thought it was a large piece of debri being blown around by the wind because its movement was so irratic.  I watched as it rose higher and became smaller,about the size of a large star. It then stopped for maybe 2 seconds.  Then it traveled at a high rate of speed to the west, it stopped and traveled at a high rate of speed to the east.  Its shape had changed to round and white or silver.  I then saw 3 more what now appeared to be orb like spheres or balls the size of large stars darting back and forth in incredible directions and formation.  These objects where perfectly round and appeared to be silver metallic as they reflected or shimmered a little light.  I watched these 4 continue to interact until they were the size of pin heads and then no longer visible.  It was a perfectly calm day with beautiful blue clear skies and no wind.  I was left very excited, awed and wowed.  The total time elapsed from when I first  noticed this object was approzimately 2 minuted maybe longer.  The size of the object was aproximately 1/3 to 1/4 the size of a full moon and became smaller the higher it rose.  I called my wife on her cell phone during my siting so when I get my cell phone bill I will know the exact time and length of my siting.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length with this witness, and we believe he is exceptionally credible.

My \"sub-division\"  is located between Gurnee to the East and Grayslake to the West. My house is one street or half a block off Route 45, 2 \u00bd blocks North of  Route 120 and just South of Gages Lake.  Looking out my back door window which gives me a panoramic view of the East edge of Grayslake including portions of the Lake County Fair Grounds which are both located just on the other side of Route 45.  Actually the back of my lot borders Grayslake since the lots fronting Route 45 have been \"taken\" by Grayslake recently. That evening looking out the kitchen door window, checking as a security measure before retiring I looked up and over towards Grayslake and just above the power lines I notice two rather large glowing objects in a stationary position.  I looked at my watch for a moment, unbelieving what I saw, it was about 2 minutes before midnight.  I quickly looked again and they were still there in the exact position in which I first spotted them.  I was awestruck and was waiting for movement, but it never occurred for about 5 minutes.  Then suddenly, the one on my left, and a little lower then the other one suddenly started moving away towards the West until I lost sight of it.  It moved out very fast but was not instantaneous and I was watching it as it departed. The other object stayed, and I wanted to get my binoculars which were in the dinning room just off the kitchen, but I hesitated figuring I would miss something.  But after a couple more minutes, without movement, I took a chance and dashed into the dining room, found the binoculars and took them out of the case and got back to the window.  This movement on my part took no more than 1-2  minutes.  As I returned the object was still there, and as I raised the binoculars up it started moving westward, just as the other one had done earlier.  Unfortunately by the time I got the binoculars focused, it was completely gone. The objects were observed as rather large lights, but they had a oblong symmetrical shape and while watching, I had the sensation that something zoomed past my window just above the roof of my house.  It happened so fast, I'm still not sure it happened, since I was mainly focusing on the two lights off to the distance.  I heard no noise, nor did I even think to go outside and try and get a better view. I have mentioned my sighting to some of my associates at work, and some of my family members, but I really can't confirm what they were, the only thing I know is that they were there, were stationary for several minutes and were not airplanes of which I have seen many times before.  Within the last few years it has been common to see many aircraft routed around O'Hare flying nearby, but those are always moving and do not provide the large light these objects did.  I feel they were UFO's and that means just what it is intended to stand for, \"Un-Identified Flying Objects\".",

We were on a military exercise out in the mountains in Sweden. I stood looking up at the stars while fetching some water out of a lake. Suddenly i saw what i first thought was a falling star. Then came another one. My friends saw it too but they said it must be a satelite (they can be seen this time of year when they pass the skies). But, the next moment i saw two moore, and they started to \"chase\" each other... They looked like stars (same size, same bright light) but they were moving so fast! It was very strange to see the \"stars\" first flying at this speed, and then stop(!!?) and change direction and start again with same speed instantly. The \"stars\" were also flying in circles, continuing chasing each other. They must have been flying at a very high altitude since they were so small. No human vessle och aircraft can fly so fast, so high and change directions like that! That is for sure!!! The experience lasted for at least 4 minutes before they suddenly dissapeared.

It didn't zig-zag or anything, but it cleared the length of the sky in under 2 minutes. I would estimate it's altitude at 10,000 feet.

It must've taken it some time to get there, but I next remember seeing a saucer shaped object hovering over the trees across the clearing from me.  I could see beings that looked like children with big heads peering through the windows at me.  I wanted to run, but I felt a hand on my shoulder.  I spun around to face a little man with big black eyes and grey skin, I think people call them the Grays.  I was paralized with fear, but he said words in a language that I could understand.  He told me that I have to find the others.  He said that they would be able to answer a simple question that we are born with the knowledge of:  Who are the sisters?

All the planes had two contrails , then one flew over going west this plane had 4 contrails that stayed in the sky for a longer period of time than the other planes that had 2 contrails. About 10 minutes later a plane flying east had 4 contrails  as this plane past over I noticed the plane pass another object with no contrail. I watched the object with no contrail. It was stationary. At first I thought it was a parachutists. After about 30 seconds I still did not notice it moving. I pointed out the object to the other person with me. She also saw it in the sky. The object appeared to be very high up in the sky. I than thought it might be the space lab reflecting the sunlight. Than out of no where three more objects appeared to the left of the 1st sighted object. These objects formed a triangle that would hold constant shape for about two minutes. The triangle would remain a triangle but two of the objects would get closer while the third would get further away. Then their triangle would get smaller. All the while the larger object remained to the left of the triangle. I called my wife out to see this. She brought out her camera and we took a couple of pictures. I got my binoculars and tried to get a closer look. What I saw was a faint blue light going between the white lights forming the triangle. When I looked at the bigger object to the left of the white lights forming the triangle I saw another blue light in the bigger object. This lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. Than another larger plane with no contrails appeared to fly out of the eastern sky at the objects. The plane veered off the the south after getting near the spot of the objects. About 4 to 5 minutes later the objects were gone from sight. They may have past over the horizon but did not appear to.",

While stand watch one night a craft of considerable size appeared over the base.  It was moving very slowly and completely silent.  It's hard to estimate size but I would guess 200 Ft. in diameter and at less than 2000 Ft. altitude.  It had rectangular \"windows\" on the outer circumference which glowed with a red-orange light as the craft slowly revolved.  I don't recall anything about the actual shape other than it was round. I think I was so transfixed by the lights that I never tried to make out anything else.  Or perhaps it was just such a dark night that the outline couldn't be seen.  I don't really know.  The craft moved slowly toward the far end of the base.  There were probably hundreds of trainees looking out the barrick windows.  As I stood there dumbstruck a base security truck pulled up to the gate I was guarding and ordered me to get it open and fast.  I did so even though my orders were that no one, not even the C.O.  was to be allowed to use that gate.  After my watch was over the sentry from across the highway which divided the two parts of the base and was in my company came over and asked me, with his mouth hanging open, if I had seen that.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectUFO w/  green lights seen twice  in NJ at night in N.J. on 539\n\r\nHere is my report on my sightings of a ufo I saw at night when I was driving home, and again I had a sighting of the same object two years later when I was driving to a friends house at night. This report is being told in all honesty, and even though these two events happened long ago, they have stuck fresh in mind to this day. Here is the report I had given to another organization not too long ago. I was asked in the reporting form to describe the lights if I had seen any, and that is where I started my report at: \"There were many round lights and they were all green. They were not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center row seemed to go around the object. Also remember there were more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one near the bottom of the center row of lights.\" The next question in the report form I was filling out, asked to give as much information about the sighting as possible: \"It was a close sighting and lights were seen well. Object was just below the tops of the trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little traffic, sometimes no traffic late at night. A road where there are woods on both sides (Alot pine trees) and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (which is Rt. 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they usually have trucks (hummers, etc) travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. I was traveling north on Rt. 539. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped the car and was looking at it, I started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was 'very slowly' moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. Panic set in and I said to myself **** ****!! Please excuse the language, but it could not be helped. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body were shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself for so long because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o's until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of all of the ufo sightings by others until I got a computer and was able to read up on sightings information. This is being told in absolute truth. (I did some searching on the about.com website on ufo sightings for in my state, and found a report posted by another lady who seemed to have seen the same object with all green lights at night in 1996.) 2 years later on another night, the same 'exact' object with green lights appeared again in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road but heading north this time on rt. 539, but for some reason I decided that maybe I'd go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to 'turn around'. Well this weird feeling came over me, I don't know why, (I'm in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road to get ready to make my u-turn which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror (I usually had this mirror turned up a little to keep any car's headlights that were behind me from shining into my eyes), I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights, this time higher in the night sky and the moon was almost full this night. I slowed down on the road and turned my head back to quickly look through the back window of the truck I was driving and was able to see this object better. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, but also not real close to each other, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the object with green lights farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these roads at the time. This time I was thinking \"Oh my God, Oh my God, I don't believe this!\" and \"It's back again!!\", and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas pedal after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto. I made it back home and said to myself, 'why when I'm on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when another car was coming around the object would disappear or it's lights would go out...' I did'nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. I would also like to ad, that both times that the object was seen, it was motionless in the sky, completely still, except for the first time where it seemed to start lowering after it was remaining still. There also was no sound whats so ever. Today I am now a professional photographer, I do alot of nature photography, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me during these two events. I would prefer being contacted through email if questions and a follow up were needed, but would consider being contacted by phone as well, even though I would'nt have an easy time at all discussing these two events.",

I was a full grown man at the time. I had a wife named ((name deleted)) and 2 kids, ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)). This is all I know. I went up into a space craft. Two beings greeted me with open arms. They showed me secrets of the world such as cold fusion, splitting the atom, and the advancement of computers. They were not threatening in any way and actually tried to comfort me. They put peaceful thoughts in my head. They also showed me what would happen if we did not stop nuclear weapons. I was feeling very sad at that time. I then blacked out or something. Only to find myself as a new born baby. I can remember being born. I know it sounds crazy but it is very true. I just recently explained my birth to my mother who was dumfounded and speechless. I have always had the feeling that I am supposed to find my original self and I have been searching ever since. I have since been contacted by the beings 3 times since my birth. They have contacted me twice in dreams and once in the night as I was driving down a deserted highway. Everytime they just show me the horrors of nuclear war. The horrors are trememndous.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We do not post all reports of alleged abduction/interaction, but we have elected to do so in this case.

I was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge at 6 pm, on my way into San Francisco for a night class when I just about died. Right before me a black jet fighter crossed very low over the Golden Gate Bridge, during rush hour traffic! I looked around to see if others saw what happened, but eveyone seemed completely unaware. I watched as the jet flew around the Bay, going over to the East Bay then moving South. I was unable to keep track of it after about 10 seconds. I asked if anyone else saw it when I arrived at school. And I watched the news to see if there were any reports. Nothing. I have seen the Blue Angels fly into the Bay many times, so I am familiar with the military aircraft. But, I have never seen anything like this before. This fly over was definately an unusual event. I was very nervous because I thought that maybe a foriegn aircraft may have been in the area, or a pilot had gone crazy and was going to do a fly by for fun.

            "characteristics": "Aircraft nearbyBlue Angles interupted by UFO/F-16 Crashes in area same Day\n\r\nListeing to Peter on Jeff Rense, made me remember this sighting. To quickly summerize myself, at the time I was in college and was in the Marines. In the Marines my duties included calling Close Air Support and artillery as a \"spotter\". I have since been able to identify US and NATO aircraft by sight and sometimes sound. I can also identify some \"Eastern Block\" aircraft. (we had flash cards of aircraft in silloette). During the annual Blue Angels Show at Pensacola Beach, I wittnessed a Chrome Sphere hovering over the Santa Rosa Sound, (the body of water the separates Gulf breeze from Pensacola Beach). At the time I was working at the beach as a lifeguard so I had seen the Blue Angels show all week as they practiced. On the final show, (a Saturday), the sky was clear and the beach was crowded. I had \"Dune Duty\", which meant that I was to stand on a tall sand dune next to our \"shack\" in case I had to administer first aid to someone. Now, I'm faceing south, as is the airshow guests as the Blue Angels are flying over the Gulf of Mexico at Pensacola Beach. So keep in mind that people are not generally going to be looking behind them to Santa Rosa Sound to the North. Seeing the Angels all week made me notice that they were \"off a bit' this day. Their Friday show was much cleaner than today. The Diamond formation looked sloppy and other details were picked up by me and the other guards. In the middle of the show the Angels anouncer stated that the show would be delayed because someone was in their airspace. I followed one of the jets with my eye as it broke from the diamond and he went out over \"the sound\". I was now faceing North. Then I saw a glint and it was a chrome sphere hovering over \"the sound.\" The F-18 closed on it and came right at the sphere, in a blur the Sphere was gone. It seemed to \"disapear\", but I saw a blur above where it was and think that it must of climbed rapidly in the direction of the blur. Later that day on the evening news, a F-16 was reported to have crashed in a neighborhood in Pensacola. That Neighborhood where the crash occured is close to Escambia Bay. The only thing that separates Escambia Bay from Santa Rosa Sound, is a thin Penensula known as Gulf Breeze. I remember thinking that the F-16 crash, the UFO and the stoppage of the Blue Angels Show, were connected. (an airshow stoppage which I've never seen growing up in Pensacola and having seen the Angels several times). As far as I know I am the only witness. This sighting had the potential for 1000s of witnesses. But I have never heard anyone with a story like this. I may have been the only wittness. I don't have the exact date correct. But I know it was the Blue Angels show at pensacola beach in 1996.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  We will attempt to confirm the date, which should not be too difficult, given that the date of Blue Angel performances is published.  Also, the date of the F-16 crash should be easy to establish from newspaper records.  If anyone can help with the exact date, we would be grateful.  PD",

As much as we tried to capture it on film we didn't, by the time my husband was pointing the camera in the right direction it was gone. Some strange things happened during this time frame.  All  of the neighborhood dogs were barking and even the two cows that live next door were \"mooing\". When we re-wound the tape to see if we caught the object that I saw, a low range, pulsating noise came through on the video that we did NOT hear audibly while filming. It went from soft to  very load and appeared as if it was coming towards us then it sounded as though it  went right through us!  It got very soft going away from us , then it disappeared. It was the oddest noise, kind of like something pulsating under water with a slight\" swishing in water\" sound too.  My husband said that it sounded like an ultrasound of an unborn baby, you know that swishing pulsing muffled sound. Anyway, the dogs and the cows all calmed down  right after this occurrence as well. My husband and I looked at one another and said, \"what the heck was that?\" and we both asked each other,\" did you hear that at all while we were filming\" ? My husband thought that something was wrong with the camera, so we filmed more stuff and it worked beautifully. Neither one of us heard anything except the normal background noises, you know, cars and of course the dogs and the cows.  We live out in a rural area on a one acre parcel. Most of the local houses are on acreage and the dogs don't bark unless someone or something has caught their attention. As for the cows, they  don't make any noise at night ever, that we can remember.  We are wondering if this  was a sound that we could NOT hear but the animals were hearing !  The animals all appeared agitated as well as uneasy.  FYI, we live in an area a little east of Mc Cord Air force base and Fort Lewis army base. We as wondering if  the military was conducting a test of  some kind, possibly  ELF or pulsating equipment?  We have the tape if you would like to hear it, or I  can try and load it onto the net and send it to you .",

I had been looking out the window periodically to see if I could see any lightning strikes.  It was slightly foggy also.  The storm was over and I was about to go to bed when I noticed a light coming though the window shades.  I opend the blinds and in my neighbors yard about 100 yars away and only around 30 feet in there air, a very bright object was glowing infront of some trees.  It was ovalish and one end was slightly tilted up.  The thing had a metalic, band through the middle with atleast 3, round, bright windows that did not seem to orbit the craft.  It was very bright but did not seem to light up and trees around it.  The ball of light was bright yellow, with long rays of light coming off of it, like the Rising Sun in the Japanese flag. The metalic band was silver/white, and was slightly brighter then the yellow.  The windows were even brighter and may have been spot lights, they were yellow also.  I had only seen it for a second or two when it started to move slowly twards the South East, it passed behind a few trees then back into the open and into my other nighbors back yard.  It had moved over  about 40 or 50 feet, and had gained about 10 feet in altatude (it was moving diaganaly).  It quickly dimmed, a tiny bit then disapeared giving the impression that it moved faster then the speed of light.  I did not hear anything at that time.  It seemed like the craft knew I was looking at it so it disapeared. And the next day I rememberd also seeing a shadow move infront of one of the  windows, but I am not sure if I actually saw it.  I have no idea what that was,  could it have been a ball of lightning?  I could also tell the next day that the UFO was atleast as big as a riding lawn mower.. Later that night I heard a two toned buzzing sound that sounded like something was idling and somthing else was spining at the same time.     Disk shaped with a very bright opaque aura or an oval with a band through the middle,  ver! y odd.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectFather &amp; son saw big glowing white disk approach thru clouds from S, depart thru clear sky to SW.\n\r\nMy father and I saw a glowing disk in the sky about 20 years ago. I was probably about 11 years old at the time. We were in Bandon, OR, visiting my grandparents, probably during summer vacation. It was probably not before 1978 and not after 1984. At the time there was an empty field behind (SW of) the house where my father and I were laying on a blanket watching a meteor shower, probably the Perseids, so it probably occurred on the night of August 11 or 12. It was perhaps an hour or two after sunset, around 10:00PM PDT. I think there was no moon, so I'm guessing that the year was 1980 based on star charts. It was breezy, and there were some low clouds to the S and SE, but most of the rest of the sky was clear. No precipitation. We saw what appeared to be a searchlight turn on, illuminating the clouds to the S, between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon. No beam was visible. The illumination was moving N toward us, following a smooth arc toward the W. By the time the light reached the edge of the clouds it had slowed down slightly and was travelling approximately W. This was about 3 or 4 seconds after I had first noticed it. It was somewhere between 50 and 70 degrees above the horizon. At this point I was surprised (and very frightened!) to see a featureless glowing white disk emerge from the clouds. Apparently the clouds had been illuminated by this disk flying through or slightly above them, rather than by a ground-based searchlight. Not sure how high it was. The light had appeared slightly fuzzy as it moved through the clouds, but against the clear sky it was a definite disk with sharply defined edges. Not quite as bright as the full moon, and slightly smaller than two moons side by side. It looked solid (opaque). It continued on its smooth arc and flew off toward the SW, gaining speed and diminishing in brightness. The elapsed time from when it emerged from the clouds until it was no longer visible was about 2 or 3 seconds. We jumped up, hurried indoors and told our other family members about it. I was too scared to go outside again. There was no sound, no blinking. I don't recall any other air traffic in the area. There was nothing in the local paper the next day. I considered reporting it to MUFON at the time, but didn't, since we had no photos. Now I wish I had at least written it down because it's hard to remember details that long ago. Now my father only remembers \"seeing something strange\" that we were both \"pretty excited about.\" I remember more detail than he does, maybe because I was so scared and because I considered reporting it and thought about how I would describe it. I'm finally reporting it to you now because I recently saw something else strange (reported to you 3/11/01), and was pleased to see 3 other reports of the same thing on your site. Better late than never, I hope! Background of the observers: I'm now a 32 year old software engineer with a B.S. in computer science and electrical engineering. My father has an M.S. in electrical engineering and is recently retired from the semiconductor manufacturing industry.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Many years ago I had some buddies show me some video tape of this thing they call THE METHOD..  It was a way to catch UFO on video or on film..  If you recall, When there is a eclips of the sun.. THere are many reports of sighting especially in souther America.. This was the principle of my friends way of spotting UFOs in the sky..  You stand in the shadow of a roof or building not looking derectly at the sun but around the corona of it.   You will obiviously see insects flying by but if you focus your eyes way up.. at about the hight of a commercial jet, there are things you can only see when they are lit up by a reflection of the sun..  I have been a witness to this many times..  Seeing pear necklace shaped objectes, chess piece objects and sphere shaped objects..  One time I saw this object that look as if it was spining. After it was way past the brightness of the sun I tracked it moving across the San Fernando Valley.  it was the same color of the sky, and if i didnt spot its reflection, ther would be no way of seeing it with the naked eye..  I have shared this method with many friends..  I am not the originator of this principle, and do not want to be sued by who ever discovered it..  So, the other night I was on the balcony of my apartment building..  It was late at night, about midnight..  There was a marine layer coming it from the south, and a fog of some sort coming from the north..  The night sky was not that clear above but getting overcast..  You could see some stars above but not much on either side of the sky.. I was only out there a min when I saw what seemed like when you see a grocery bag in the sky when there is a wind kicking up, but it was not windy..  It was the same color of the cloudy sky on both sides of the sky.. It made no sound..  And it traveled from east to west across the sky..  Very low.  Aout 500 feet I would say..  I thought it might be a balloon from a car dealership around here, but it was no! t perfec tly round like a balloon..  I cannot say how big it was,  Maybe the size of a small car.. or as large as a 747 jet..  It was spinning and seemed to cloak itself with it seroudings..  I was only able to see it when it when though the clear area of the sky, and I was able to track it, but then it stopped..  I got very scared and went inside..  After that I herd a helecopter go by in the same derection..  Has there been any new sevalance craft that the US, or and other countries might be looking at us??  I would think, or has this been something of a UFO origen??  I do not do drugs or drink..  I am very interested in finding more info about this type of craft, that can acually cloak itself with its surrondings..  Thanks for any ifo..",

It was me, my mom, my sister and a friend of hers.  I saw a starlike object in the sky from a few miles away, and told my mom that I didn't remember seeing that there.  I love to watch the sky.  Anyway, we got closer, and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my whole life.  We saw a UFO.  I screamed for my mom to pull over, because it was getting lower and lower and I wanted to see it.  She pulled into a driveway, and we were in awe gazing out the window.  Being in such amazement, I stumbled out of the car, my family screaming in fright.  I was directly under this thing.  It was a huge oval shaped craft about 20 feet above my head.  Lights went around it, different colors.  They blinked.  I heard nothing.  It just sat there, over my head as if to let me look at it.  I saw a small square in the bottom, like a door.  The dimensions were hard to tell, I was only 16 at the time.  I do remember though, there was definetly not enough room for an adult to stand up in there.  I was so dumbfounded, as I had always read about UFO's but never really believed.  There I was, a young small town girl, seeing what was the most amazing thing in my life.  It hovered there, what seemed like hours, but was 2 or 3 minutes.  Then, before I could blink, it sped off like lightning.  NO SOUND!! Nothing, no whirr, no hum, nothing.  I was in shock.

(sightings ocurr regularly at the lake and towards Creal) The craft is commopnly seen by myself and others in these locals soi was of no suprize to me when I saw it last night with two others but it did suprize me to find a field the next day with a circle in it on a patch of ground clearly visible to any one from the road. I also went back and took pictures and plan to sell them.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectThree globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitude\n\r\nAn old report for the record.  This sighting took place a long time ago, but I remember it very clearly.  I\u2019m estimating the date by the age I believe I was at the time (16) and by the month we always vacationed.  Weekapaug is a small town on the south shore of Rhode Island.  There are a series of large tidal ponds along this shore that are connected to the ocean by channels about 100' wide.  The Weekapaug channel has stone jetties on either side that stick out about 100' from the beach.   On this night I was sitting on the tip of the eastern wall at about 10:30pm looking at stars.  The sky was clear overhead, but there was a heavy mist over the water to an altitude of about 30'.  As I sat there facing the sea, and due south, I noticed three dim, translucent, globular lights move by from east to west in a tight triangle formation.  The light was a pale white.  I'd estimate the speed at 50mph, the altitude at 75 to 100 feet above the water and the distance from me between 100 and 200 yards.  I watched them from about 160 degrees to about 225 degrees at which point they faded in the mist. My first thought was that they were the lights from a car's headlights hitting thicker fog out over the water, but the following observations seen to conflict with that theory. 1) The lights were well defined.  Each one looked like a frosted globe light you might see in front of someone's house, only a little more translucent and defused.  I don't know whether the lights were that way by nature or if the mist was defusing the light.  2) There were three lights that held the exact pattern, which was one light in the lead with the other two trailing at an equal distance.  3) The lights maintained a straight course and steady speed.  If they were the projection of car lights, the car would have to be making a tight turn to move the beams left to right so fast.  In such a scenario, you would expect the lights to either swing in an arc around the source, or, if they were shining on the straight edge of a fog bank just offshore, to diffuse and move away faster as the source beams swung to an orientation more parallel to the surface they were shining on.  These lights maintained a distinct shape and straight course, a very steady speed and perspective that changed in what seemed an appropriate way for an object traveling in a straight line.  In other words, as the object moved away, the two rear lights became more face-on to me than they were when it was straight out.  4) The closest a car could have been was about 200 yards behind me and the beams would have had to come right over me.  I looked around very quickly, but saw no car, nor did I see any sign of beams passing by.  Afterwards, I tried to identify a spot where a car could have made such a turn while maintaining line-of-sight with the full range in which I saw these lights and I couldn't ID such a spot. The lights struck me as a source themselves and not a reflection, and although the lights were diffused I had the distinct impression they were 3-dimensional.  I've thought about whether they might have been from a boat passing by, but there was no sound with these lights and it was a quiet night.  Several of the points above seem to conflict with this theory as well, not to mention the speed.  They definitely were not the promotional spots that you often see in the night sky.  If they were something other than projections, they could have been three independent lights in a tight formation, or part of one craft.  I'd estimate the apparent size of each of them at about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  I would not go so far as to say these lights were extraterrestrial, but for me they were certainly UFO's in the sense that I have been unable to associate them with a rational explanation despite years of trying. Also, knew a guy who was swimming on Weekapaug's Inn Beach late one afternoon in the summer of 1978 and swears he saw a \"flying saucer\" come in off the water, fly straight overhead at a relatively low altitude and proceed inland.  That's all I know of that sighting. I was 16 at the time of my sighting and was not on drugs or drinking.  I was into astronomy at the time and enjoyed stargazing, hence my reason for being out on the dark tip of the jetty at night away from distracting lights.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

About 5-degrees south of the star Regulus (or at about 207-degrees true, 55-degrees elevation), my attention was diverted by a dim formation of what I think was five points of white (or starlight-like) light moving east to west. I estimate the brightness of each light to be about magnitude 3.0, only slightly brighter than the dimmest stars visible in our local sky at the time. Apparent size of the formation was approximately 1/2-degree, or the size of the full moon. The shape of the formation was initially diamond-shaped but did not remain constant -- the distances between the lights changed rapidly and the overall shape changed to more of a square or trapezoidal shape. There seemed to be a fifth light which may have been ziz-zagging behind the other four. As I stepped out from behind the wall I was using to block nearby streetlights, the lights quickly pulled into line with each other, and distictly resembled a V-formation as viewed from behind and slightly below (i.e. a nearly-horizontal \"V\"). The formation faded in the southwest sky (about 240-degrees true) at an elevation of about 30 degrees, appearing to recede into the distance. The formation covered about 30 degrees of the sky in about ten seconds and traversed an arc, the formation's bearing smoothly shifing from west to southwest. (I consulted sky maps after the fact for azimuth/elevation estimates.) The dimness of the objects, combined with their speed and my own perplexity while observing them, make exact recollection of their maneuvers imprecise. During the observation! , I was preoccupied with comprehending what I was seeing. My first thought was high-altitude aircraft or missiles, but the lights' maneuverability ruled that out. About midway through the observation, I thought that the lights took on a slightly ruddy color, and I considered the fact that I was seeing a formation of birds reflecting the orange sodium vapor streetights of the city. I tried to make out flapping wings or some type of form but could not -- to move that quickly across the sky and relative to one another, birds would have to be fairly low and, given the brightness of the sky (residual twilight, urban light pollution and full moon), I should have been able to make out silhouettes. I am a radio broadcast engineer by trade with a lifelong interest in science and astronomy. I have seen many things in the sky (yes, I've even seen the insect-eating UFOs in Excalibur's spotlight in Vegas), but nothing I could not identify. I don't know what I saw tonight, but that may be due to the short observation time and faintness of the objects. I am submitting this report in the event that it corroborates other reports.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>I believe we spoke briefly with this witness.  We found him to be highly credible, as his written report seems to suggest, as well.  PD",

I couldn't tell if it appeared and then disappeared, or whether the lights came on and then went off again (which would hide it from view in the night sky).  It was not a spot light or an airplane.  A spotlight would change in distance as it tracked across the clouds, and the beam would be visible and could be tracked to it's source.  It had no running lights like a plane would, and as I stated earlier, it was silent.  I live near and work at Paine Field, so I see planes come and go all day long, and this was something completely different.

I haven't told this story but to a select few... In the Fall of 1994 two friends and I were driving my car from Glenwood Springs, Colorado to Phoenix.  We got a late start, and did most of the driving well after dark. We passed through Moab, Utah and continued South. I had never been passed Moab, and was surprised when we started passing through some hills on a small two lane highway that was surrounded on both sides of the road by Lodgepole Pines. I recall this distinctly and paid close attention to the sign that read \"Welcome to the White National Forest.\" As I came over the crest of a large hill, I noticed in the high distant sky what appeared to be three yellowish-white lights that formed a triangle. I thought it was VERY strange, and woke my friend up whom was in the passenger seat. I didn't say anything, just poked him. We both sat speachless at a dead stop in the road, and watched as the three still lights started to rotate as if it were one. They rotated round and round for a few seconds and then all of the sudden the three lights shot off in the three oppisite directions that each of the \"points\" of the triangle were pointing towards. That was it... we sat in the middle of the dark desolate highway for a few moments trying to make sense of it. Our third friend asleep in the back never realized what went on while he slept in a car in the middle of the desert. A few years later I lost my breath when I watched the movie \"Fire In The Sky,\" and saw that the story took place in \"The White National Forest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\r\n((ADDENDUM))\n\r\nDear Mr. ((deleted)),\n\r\nThank you very much for the excellent report!  Yes, we are very interested in receiving such reports from the past.  Sometime, they are very useful in corroborating other events elsewhere in the country.\n\r\nDo you think you might be able to pin down, and confirm, the precise date?  For example, would you still have cancelled checks, fuel receipts, or charge card records for the trip that would allow you to confirm the dates of your trip?  That would be very helpful for us.\n\r\nThanks again for sharing the information with our Center!\n\r\nCordially,\n\r\nPeter Davenport\n\r\n((END QUERY))\n\r\n((RESPONSE))\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I can pin it down.  It was 3-3-94.  Not the Fall as I recalled.  Sorry my timeline was eschewed but the details are engrained. I was able to look this up via a concert we attended while in\r\nPhoenix. I would have looked up the date earlier, but I wasn't planning on submitting this tonight! Thanks for letting me bend your ear!\n\r\n((END RESPONSE))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

All of us witnessed this light in the sky that appeared approximatly 1 mile above us. As we watched the light it began to come closer and closer, within 2 minutes the small light began to descend above the pond. the closer it got the brighter it became. Within seconds, the light (craft) had desended to approximately 100 yards over the pond. THE ENTIRE AREA SURROUNDING THE POND APPROXIMATLY ONE HALF MILE WAS DAYLIGHT. The craft sat there for maybe 2 minutes then began to ascend. In a minutes notice, it was gone. We all know what we saw, that was 34 years ago. This is a real life story that happened 34 years ago.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectI sighted a disc shaped object hovering above the trees in a residential area of southwest Los Angeles in early 1970\n\r\nMy sighting took place in the Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles in February of 1970.  While traveling north on LaBrea Avenue, coming down the hill toward Coliseum Ave, I saw very bright lights, resembling lights in a stadium, but they appeared to be too high up to be from a stadium (there was no stadium in that area.) These lights seemed odd so the driver of the car decided to investigate.  We went in their direction into a residential area that was on the north west side of Rodeo Rd and LaBrea Avenue. I'm not possitive of the exact location because I was new to Los Angeles at that time and didn't know the area well.  I did, however, know LaBrea and Rodeo Rd intersection. When we approached the area that seemed to be the source of the lights we traveled down a residential street that had a \"T\" intersection.  As we approached this intersection, and turned right, our car headlights turned toward a very large object hovering above the tree tops and electric wire poles. As our lights turned toward this object, it flashed two lights back at us as if signaling back in response to our headlights shining toward it.  This object was at the corner of this intersection and was large enough to cover the full width of the street as well as part of the house nearest that corner.  We immediately drove under it, which enabled me to see the bottom. The bottom was a light color that appeared to be either sand color or a light beige and it had the appearance of a wheel with a hub and spokes radiating from it, so my assumption is that it was disc shaped.  These \"spokes\" appeared to be dimensional rather than painted and at the center was a light that was red when we passed under.  I couldn't determine the actual shape of the top because it was very dark outside, and I couldn't see the outline due to the bright lights that flashed back at us. I assumed that the lights were on the front of the vehicle but cannot say if there were other lights. This object made absolutely no sound and was completely motionless when we encountered it. We drove under it, pulled over to the side of the street just beyond it, at which time the driver of the car became hysterical because she recoginzed it to be a UFO. I wanted to get out to have a better look but the passenger side of the door was jammed due to a previous accident and wouldn't open. I could not get the driver to move to let me out. By the time she pulled herself together, started the car engine and made a U-turn to head back in the direction of the UFO, it was gone.  It made no sound when it moved off.  I don't know whether it moved sideways or straight up but it must have taken off at a fast speed because the whole episode seemed to be very brief.  When we reached the corner where it had been hovering, I tried to look in the sky and spot it.  I did see lights in the far distance, west of our location, and at the time I assumed these lights could have been the object.  In retrospect I cannot say for certain.  It may have moved sidways, up or it may have vanished.  I don't know. About a week or two after this event, while returning home from evening school in downtown Los Angeles, I was a passenger riding on the Santa Monica Freeway, heading west of downtown.  Needless to say, I was watching the skys trying to see this object again.  I did see a bright stationary light in the sky, to the left of the freeway in the area of Normandie or Western Avenue and south of the freeway.  As I looked at it, wondering if this was the same UFO, the light \"winked out.\"  It was like someone turning off a light and then there was nothing. The day after my initial sighting, the driver of the car and I called several places, including Goodyear just to confirm it was not a blimp we had seen, although we knew it wasn't. Also, it was not a helicopter, as you can hear them a mile away. Goodyear confirmed that no blimps had been in the air at all because of the wind conditions. The car driver called an office of the Air Force and was told they knew nothing.  Upon making further calls she was told this was a vehicle being tested by Hughes Aircraft, and that the neighborhood had been notified. This was 1970 and to my knowledge we had no vehicles that were shaped like this or that could perform in this manner.  To date, we still don't unless they are really more secret than some of the black projects.  I got a pretty good look at the bottom side of this UFO as we drove under and there were no wings or apendages that I could see and it was totally silent and motionless until it moved away from the area.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

We had no \"running water,\" so every nite I took a bucket and went to the RR water car and got the water for the nite.  It was a trip of about 300 yards each way.  I was about 1/4 of the way to the tracks when there was a very bright flash of light in the sky.  It was bright enough that it cast very black shaddows in front of my body.  I stopped, turned and saw what appeared to be a very large object on fire at about 45 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be about 10 miles distance.  I could observe what appeared to be strucural members (like the beams you would see on a bridge) that were outlined by the fire.  I watched this object move across maybe 30 degrees till it disapeared behind \"castledome\" butte.  It appeared to be below the mountains to our North-east, and the butte to our NW,and went below the crest of the butte.  I told my mother what I had seen,and she said it was maybe an airplane, but I had never seen a plane that looked like that.  There were no wings, or tail surfaces, and these would have been visible in the light it was causing.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

This one particular morning I had just finished my  fishing it was time to leave. As I walked up the stairway of the seawall I noticed a group of people looking upward. I glanced up and saw this huge Cigar shaped craft it apparently had come in off the gulf of Mexico. The size I estimated to be approximately 300 ft long. It was extremely low I estimated it to be no higher than 150 ft. It had no windows made no noise no apparent means of propulsion no type of emission.  It moved very slowly. One of the people in the crowd nudged me and said \"Am I seeing what I think I am seeing?\" After which I replied yes you are. This craft moved about a block away made its own cloud and disappeared. The weather was a perfectl;y clear day. In the next few days I did not see anything in the news media. I however called HUFON and reported my observation. The person I talked to said that particular craft had been sighted all over Texas.\n\r\n((ADDENDUM))\n\r\n\"Peter B.

As a boy, I used to love to look at the night sky through my binoculars. Occasionally I would spot a satellite just after dark. Satellites were easily recognized by their steady, fast paced bright light. On this occasion, I spotted a satellite moving south to north in the eastern sky. When I trained my binoculars on the light, the magnification revealed that instead of one light, there were two, one following another. I watched for about ten to fifteen seconds as the two lights moved along the same path. Then, suddenly the rear light instantaneously changed direction and speed and faded to black as it zoomed off in an abrupt turn.  Through my binoculars looking toward the northeast, the two objects were moving from a two o'clock position toward an eight o'clock position. The rear obect then turned toward a one o'clock position. It seemed to do so without any hesitation whatsoever. It was many years later that I realized that what I had seen might be a UFO following a terrestrial satellite.\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

It was 9:50pm.  As I reached the area adjacent to West Seattle, I spotted a light in the sky, which at first I took for an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field or Seatac Intl. Airport.  However, after less than a minute, I looked up again and noticed that the light had not moved and that I, rather, was moving toward this light which hovered midair above the neighborhood on the East side of the highway, approximately 70 to 100 feet up.  As I drove past the object, I looked at it through my sunroof and wondered if it was a helicopter.  I noticed the counter-clockwise cycling strobes of white lights tracing the pattern of a diamond under the craft while two or more other white lights glowed without flashing.  Moments later, I saw a second identical object on the same side of the highway less than 200 feet North of the original one.  As I scanned the skyline, I realized that two more identical stationary craft were hovering above the downtown area at approximately the same height.  After an accidental detour due to the distraction, at the James Avenue exit, I returned to the highway and proceeded toward the University District where I saw two more on my right (East) and another on my left which was moving.  I watched the moving object, which passed above me NW to SE about 100 feet up.  After it passed out of my field of vision, I watched another hovering, stationary craft with bright blue and red blinking lights remeniscent of a police light bar.  At this point I decided to pull over and get out of my vehicle when the next one came into view.  As I drove on, I did not witness any others.  At this time I switched on the Art Bell show, just beginning. Before the program, local KOMO Seattle news had nothing to report on the matter and Neither did Art Bell or his callers.  All of the craft, with the exception of one were identical and behaved like helicopters or Harrier jets.! Becaus e of their apparent size, I first believed the craft to be double rotor helicopters.  I looked around at other motorists driving beside me but there were no other noticeable witnesses.",

I remeber seeing the object that was about 80 feet in dia. has a row of what I would call ports but I have no idea what the real purpose of them are. It had a raised center peice at the top with an outline of a hatch. Side of the hatch was a window and in it we saw a figure moving about inside but was unable to make it out. The next thing we remember we were geting back in the car.

We had begun our decent into Portland, just east of The Dalles, Oregon. At approximately   18,000 feet, which is my best guess, we were above the Hood River/Bridge of The Gods area. I always look out the window, and this case was no different. I travel a lot with my job, and I have never seen anything like this before, or sense. As I was looking out the window, a very bright light appeared, even with our Northwest airline, and about 1/4 mile away, to the north. At first, I did not know what to think. It was circular, and bright white, and if I had to guess, it looked to be about 50 feet diameter. I began to wonder more about it when it kept pace with the jet, and then it suddenly slowed or stopped, as we kept going. It then came imediately back even with us, and closer, and I then could see the most brilliant, flourescent, pink light around the bright white light, and then a very brilliant, flourescent purple l! ight around the most outer area. the only round part was the white center. The pink and purple were surrounding the sides, and this made it appear to be football shaped, but with deffinate edges, and that is why I call it diamond shape. This whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. The craft made a few sudden direction changes, and then left very fast and was gone. I told friends about this at the time, but did not know where to report it.",

My girlfriend and I saw something very similar last night (5/10/2001, at roughly 11:35 PM) from the Checkers parking lot that was definitely a jet aircraft (I think a commercial airliner). The aircraft was very low in the sky (larger than a quarter at arms length) and moving from the SW to the NE. It was moving rapidly relative to an observer on the ground, though not especially fast relative to another conventional aircraft in the sky, and due to the darkness of the sky and lighting pattern on the aircraft when viewed directly underneath it had a vague boomerang or triangular shape. However, as I was standing outside and could concentrate on watching the object (unlike the person who reported the 1999 sighting, who was driving in his car), I could barely make out an aircraft body and tail section bisecting the boomerang. The craft looked very strange when I first noticed it, as it had two unblinking(?) white lights (one on each wing) roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back on each wing (measured from the body to the tip of the wing) and a single unblinking(?) red light on the body between the wings (thus the apparent V shape), but as before once I stared at it awhile I could make out the body of the aircraft. I heard no sound when it flew overhead, though as there was a thunderstorm some distance to the north (thus significant winds at the jet\u2019s altitude) that\u2019s not surprising. The jet was in sight for about 30 seconds or so (very rough time estimate). Lawrence is in the flight path of several commercial airlines stopping at MCI (Kansas City International) airport and has been for the past several years (as early as 1996 my friends and I used to sit out on the patio with cigarettes and beer and, to pass the evening hours, played a game where we would see who could see each jet first as it flew overhead from SW to NE). Between 8:00 PM and midnight dozens of jets cross over the town from SW to NE, though not usually at such a low altitude. I suspect that what the man and his wife saw on 9/29/1999 was a low altitude jet on approach to MCI.",

These lights from left to right where red, white and green in a triangurlar formation with the white light slightly above the other two, these lights did not flicker or fade or change colors and remained intact and did not devate from it's west south west course.  These lights where very very bright and stood out cleanlly on a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the area at all.  We looked at them for a short time maybe two mins and then each other, at that time we did not know what we saw, but as I looked around behind us I saw 4 high alltitude jets pursuing in the direction of the lights at a high rate of speed with enough alltitude to leave contrails behind them, they criss crossed the sky several times in an attempt to intercept the lights.  As the jets passed over head I remarked to my wife that what ever it was the naval air base at Brunswick Maine had scrambled jets to check it out, as I pointed them out to her she saw exactly what I saw, 4 jets trying to vecter an intercept course with the lights in the west south west sky.  We first noticed the lights some where between Portland and Kittery, The jets as far as we saw did not catch up to the lights. When we crossed the bridge at Kittery heading back into NH our view of the sky changed due to landscape in that area and could no longer see the jets nor the lights. I believe that the lights we saw was not any type of aircrft I've ever seen and most certainlly had to have been seen by many motorist on I-95 So. as the traffic was moderate to heavy that day and it was so Bright that you would need to be blind not to see it, still to this day I've heard of no reports of this sighting and have checked newspapers from NH and Maine from then till now. Also I believe that it was picked up on radar at Brunswick naval air base and the air p! ort at p ortland. My wife and I are of sound mind and very honest and creditable folks and have worked in the electronic warfare divisions of several firms for many years and have seen some unbelievable technologies being developed, but this was unlike any thing we had ever seen before.

This person was a member of an elite, secret, military airplane crash team in the 1940's. The team investigated several airplane crashes. Then, about 6 months before the Roswell event, this crash team was ordered to race by land to a crash scene in a mountain wilderness area. The team had to force hike into the crash site.  The hike consumed the better part of 11/2 days since it was extremely difficult to find the crash site. Once discovered, it was quickly obvious that something had slammed into the top side of the mountain, and %100 exploded into thousands of palm sized pieces which were strewn all over the forest floor. My witness picked up a sample and conducted simple field tests on the strange object. The tests defied the known laws of engineering and physics.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Original report Description follows:\n\r\n1940's secret, elite military crash team member  reveals  another UFO crash  event  months  before  Roswell\n\r\nMy witness is a former crew chief who in the 1940's was in charge of a team that  repaired military fighter airplane engines at a famous military airbase. The crew specialized in fast engine repair. My witness was also a member of a secret military airplane crash team. This elite crash team was always on alert to speed to a disaster either by air of ground. The team was composed of civilians, enlisted men and officers. My witness became experienced in airplane crashes. He knew what to expect, what to look for, what to do upon arrival at a crash scene. At this particular crash, it was quite obvious that the craft had slammed into the side of a forested mountain and blew up into thousands of small objects scattered over a large area. Field tests revealed startling results. A shroud of secrecy settled. After that came Roswell.\n\n\n\r\nEND ADDENDUM))",

In November of last year, I was on my way to pick my wife up from work at Cabella's. It was a very windy, cold night, not fit for small aircraft to be taking off from our tiny airport, so I guess that's why I noticed this in the first place. As I was going around towards the back of the building on the access road, I saw what appeared to be a flying canoe go over my Jeep. White bottom, with an alternately blinking white light on the front and rear. As it passed over my windshield from N to S, I rolled down my window for a better look. All I could see was the bottom, and this thing looked like I said- a flying canoe, with the 2 blinking lights. In fact, this thing was so cheezy looking I laughed out loud. It looked like a really piss-poor carnival gimic. The lights looked like 60-watt light bulbs, nothing even remotely resembling modern avionic marker lights- no red or green.And with a strong wind out of the W, this thing was low enough that I could see that it had no wings, and appeared to be unaffected by the wind- no wobbling like small aircraft do with a strong side-wind blowing.  I am a defense contr., and am very familiar with aircraft. This was definitely NOT one of 'ours'. I was more amused, than impressed.",

There is a road about five miles south-west of Sullivan, WI. A few other people along with myself have witnessed strange lights and objects along this quiet road. The lights are red, white and sometimes multied colored. They move strangely in ways that plane could not. They appear from below the treeline, skim atop the trees and then will dip below the trees again. I have seen so many different lights and objects that I couldn't possibly explain them all. I have spent countless hours gazing upward. There was also a mentally retarded individual that disappeared from a nearby town, who was medically dependent and could not survive long without his medication. He was gone for four days in late October, and then reappeared 100 feet off of this road, unhurt, suffering only from slight dehydration. There is also a federal weather station located near the road. I always wondered if the weather station was a cover for something els. Or perhaps a landmark used by ET life. All I know is that I have seen things that I can not explain. The sightings usually occur between 21:00 and 24:00. They last sometimes 15-20 minutes. For the best chances face due east on the road. Most of the sightings are seen in the eastern sky. The name of the road is Herr Road. From Sullivan, WI take Hwy E south out of town about five miles. Herr Road is on the east side of the road.

I arose from the sofa to slip back to bed when a bright reddish orange triangle shaped object caught my attention in the night sky.  The blinds were open on the patio door and the bright light was first visible in the top upper left corner of the door as the bright object became descending toward me.  At first I thought it was a falling airplane but realized it was a UFO.  My glasses were in the bedroom so I turned and started yelling, \"There's something in the sky!\"  My husband and I met in the bedroom door and I told him to look out the patio door as I groped around in the dark for my glasses.  When I got back to the den, my granddaughter was on her knees in the playpen looking out the door where my husband was also standing and looking.  The blinds over the double windows on the left wall were also open (we lived in a rural area with few trees and no outside lights).  Through those windows, this huge object, changing colors, making a droning noise, was rolling about 30 ft off the ground and apx 20 ft from the house.  It was spectacular!  I thought it was crashing.  The shape of the object had changed from triangular to cylindrical but was all ablur with the changing colored lights and the rolling motion.  It went directly behind our house and three small white planes enterred it from different directions, very fast like bees.  As it cleared the small hill behind our property, it shot a bright green star at us that got larger as it came closer then seemed to just fade out.  We marveled over the event for a few minutes, and surprisingly enough, went back to bed and to sleep (including the baby) and didn't mention it again for approximately forty hours. This was reported in the Dallas Morning News on December 10, 1990, as a Soviet booster rocket plunging to earth.  However, their archived story is somewhat different from the story that was actually printed in the newspaper. We witnessed the event in Canton, Texas which is fifty-five miles east of Dallas.  The object was first seen in the southwest coming east then turned and headed due west towards Dallas.  It appeared to be propelled and not out of control.  It was an unforgetable experience!",

We were lying on cots when I noticed a three \"stars\" in a triangular fashion. They were very high, like a satellite in distance as far as how high they appeared. Difficult to judge. Regardless, I felt dizzy because it appeared that the \"stars\" were moving. Kind of like when you lay back and watch the clouds move and get disorientated. I realized, however, by watching other stars that the objects were indeed moving. I basically freaked out. From the distance that they appeared to be away the objects had to be MILES apart. Possibly 10 miles each? I would have to ask someone who is an expert on it. They moved slowly, from the distance we were seeing, and in an arc. Certainly NOTHING man made could make the arc shape movement at that height and with such an abnormal movement. They didn not go in a perfect arc. Rather the formation somewhat lumbered along. I didn't notice and cannot say for sure that the object was not a whole oject rather than a formation. I was to excited to pay attention if it blocked out stars as it moved. It didn't appear that it did. It was an arc overall but no apparent path that they were going. Everyone watched it in amazement. The formation was not an even sided  triangular. Easy to draw but harder to explain. The object literally faded into the night after, what seemed like, about two minutes in view. Not going fast, just disappearing. I personally am a ((deleted in computer networking and an ((deleted books. My spouse is an aspiring ((deleted in Nashville, TN. Two ((children, typical ((children I suppose. They didn't really understand the significance other than dad getting so excited. There was absolutely no sound from the objects at all, and it is quiet there. Too far up to hear a sound though, as it was more at a satellite height or higher.\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be serious minded, and seemingly quite credible.  Our first suspicion was that the witnesses may have been witnessing three satellites flying in unwavering formation, but his impression was that they did not move in a straight line.

Satellites probably would have disappeared sequentially, as each of them entered the Earth's terminator, I.e. shadowed side, away from the Sun.  \n\r\nPlease see other reports for this same date from all across the U.

I was outside with my friend ((name deleted)), skygazing like I have done for years, I am an avid astronomy buff. I know all of the things that should be in the sky, why and all of that. Tonight I saw something in the sky that I cannot explain, and when I think of all the possible things it could have been, the closest thing I can envision is a formation of Air Force jets. We were skygazing all over the sky, but when I first saw the formation, it was in the south/ south east.   It slowly moved from the S/SE to the North then vanished out of sight.  I quickly asked my friend if he saw it as well, and he looked and said what the hell is that ((name deleted))?  I said I have no idea, standing there with my eyes wide. My first reaction was that it was a seagull being lit up by the street lights and we could see the belly of it. But then i realized it was not, due to the fact that this was WAY too high to be any bird. Or was it? I quickly took the binoculars we were using to tour the city sky and focused on the formation. to my surprise, it looked the same as it did with my naked eye. These were 10X50 binocs, and I cannot explain why i did not see any more detail. Now this is where it gets tricky, because it was either a very large object, or perhaps dozens of small objects flying in formation. they were all a solid red color, but *very* faint. My friend thought they changed color to a dull orange, but I could not see that. They did not blink, it was just a steady, *very* dull red of basically dots moving across the sky VERY high up. Have you ever seen a sattelite from earth when it passes overhead? Well, it looked like that, a steady light, but not white, red, and much duller than a sattelite. I only wish I had my telescope out. I was SO mad later on for not bringing it out. When we could not see them anymore, my friend wanted to go do something else, but I said wait- listen. Do you hear anything? He said no. I heard nothing the ENTIRE time, and I know what a plane sounds like even that high up. It was dead quiet, no sounds after they passed over head, nothing. It was very errie in fact. I in my 10 years of being an amature astronomer, have never seen anything like this in the sky, and nothing I know of in space can produce this, and nothing I know of in terms of aircraft can produce this to my knowledge.  And I know alot about space and the sky. The weather was crystal clear, with great seeing and no humidity. A cold front passed by about 2 hours before the event, and when I thought about it I wondered if I saw my first ' ball lightning' but the stories I have heard about ball lightning none of them say it can last this long, nor be this high. I do not know what else to say. I never expected to post to this website, I only started to come here to read the reports people post and try to think what they could have been in the 'real world' , like a certian star out that night or something. etc. I wish I could find out what it was in the sky, it confused me. It scared me frankly, cause nothing I have ever learned prepared me for this. This is the first time I saw something in the sky that I could not explain right away since I was a child, and learning in school. Well, here is the report, as quickly as I can write it. Sorry for the typos, I am so tired. :)  Oh wait I just remembered, as always, there was tons of air traffic in the NYC metro area, planes going to kennedy, newark, etc. I am used to their patterns and they were flying the same patterns when this was going on to my knowledge. But I was looking at the formation the most. :)",

This area is about 150 miles south of the U.S. - Mexico border.  While there in early evening of 25 April 2001, he saw a bright object moving steadily south over the Sea of Cortez, about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was his impression that it was reflecting the sun, which had just set.  He grabbed the binoculars he keeps handy for watching animal life and saw in front of the bright reflection what appeared to be a cylindrical nose.  When asked if he could see any other structural detail, he said: \"Although the object appeared to be reflecting the sun, the sky was too dark to see any other detail.  If it had had wings, I doubt I could have seen them.\"  He was quite certain the object was no more than 500 - 1000 feet up, much lower than the aircraft which fly over that area.  He will not estimate his distance from the object.  But at 30 degrees elevation, trigonometry gives distance to the object as twice its height above eye level, or 1000 - 2000 feet.  He heard no sound whatsoever and saw no trail.  Sighting duration from first appearance as the object came out of shadows until it reentered them again on its southward linear path was about two minutes.  Weather was clear, calm, beautiful, and about 70 Fahrenheit. Mr. ((deleted)) was not a UFO believer previously but is unable to relate this object to any previously-seen aerial objects and concludes it was some kind of UFO.  Because of the low altitude, he rejects an earth-satellite explanation.  Moreover, the object would have been moving in an unusual, polar orbit.",

In regards to the question of the triangle form I saw this eve 05/13/01 @ aprox 10:30 pm mtn time. Yes, it did appear to be moving slightly South/eastwardly. Basically what I saw was three points of light in a perfect triangular form. I saw no object within these three points , albeit the perfect unison movement of the lights together and the steady pace they traveled at suggested the three corner lights that formed the perfect triangle were the corners of an object I simply could not see with my naked eye.  Each of these three  lights were no bigger than the star dots one sees with their naked eye when staring up at the night sky, however the vast distance between each point was tremendous, much larger than any sattelite  or space\r\nshuttle could be and the brightness of each dot of \"seeming\" star light was comparable to the shine reflect of a planet being viewed in the night sky with little more than a pair of binnoculars. The departure from my sight was due as follows: As it moved away in its south eastward direction-  The roof of my balcony blocked my view.. by the time I raced downstairs and made my way to the back of my condo into open space it was already gone. However, please note: That although to my naked eye it appeared to move at a steady pace (much like one sees an airplane in the night sky moving at a steady pace),... It took me aprox only 60 seconds or less to reach that open space in the back of my condo. Now, Considering the apparant largeness of this triangular formation, for it to have disappeared from view altogether or be out of my eyes range in this short period of time, I can only imagine it was in fact traveling at a much greater speed than my eyes originally perceived.  I read some of the reports at the sightings web site about a ?stealth blimp?.. in the shape of an enormous triangle and am currently surfing around the web to see if I can dig up some info on it to see if it perhaps was due to fly over the Denver area this eve...  Albeit, if you have any ideas on what this particular object was.. I do hope you might email me back when you get a chance to let me know. After reading some of the other recent reports filed, apparently others in this area of the west have seen similar triangle point objects as well, that have yet to be explained.\r\nThanks,  name deleted))\n\r\nEND FIRST RESPONSE))\n\r\nSECOND RESPONSE))\n\r\nDear Mr. Davenport: In my follow up web investigation for info about my 5/13/01 unexplained ighting, I learned that according to skunk works at Lockeed, reported in an article by author deleted)) @ publication deleted)) site:  http:URL deleted)) \n\r\nWhat I saw fits the perfect description given for the Stealth Blimp, which apparently has the ability to elude radar and be virtually invisible to the eye in the night sky - so that all one sees are three triangle blips of seeming star light. It is reported that this blimp is also aprox 1,000 feet long! \n\r\nHowever, apparently the project is top secret so the public is not allowed to know when it makes its test runs or operations or where. So am betting this is EXACTLY! what I saw tonight..-And- what others have been reporting over the past month or two.

I was taking my dog out before I turned in for the night. I live approximately six miles from town so it is quite dark at night. I sat down on my porch waiting for my dog, the porch is orientated to the due West. My eye caught something moving and at first assumed it was an airplane or helicopter. It was not moving 'right' for a plane and then thought it must be a helicopter at a high hover. It was slowing drifting and then changed color. It was then that I was curious, it was not a plane, why then would it have wing lights that are different colored? I called my for wife to see it and she was not very impressed. It was nothing spectacular. An aircraft was then flying nearly over me at this time and I used it to attempt to judge the distance and altitude of the light. I judged it to be approximately 20 to 25 miles west of me and at 5000 feet above the ground. During the time I observed the light it changed colors several times, at times appearing red, white or blue/white.When it changed colors it blended, it just did not change as if one side was one color and another side was another color. It never moved quickly or any higher or closer. My wife observed it for approximately 5 minutes and then called my Father in law to watch it with me. He watched it with me for another 10 minutes. He said that he observed another two lights to the south that resembled the first. I then called the County Sheriff and asked if they had had any other calls. The Deputy I spoke to then went to the roof and attempted to observe it as well. I know nothing of his observations or lack of. At 0010 hrs the light darkened to a dark red and descended out of site slowly and I did not observe it again. I have served in the Army during Desert Storm and have seen many of the worlds' high performance aircraft at very close and far distances in combat maneuvers. I have ridden in Pavelows, Pavehawks, Ch-53's, British High Pro Ch-47's, and other conventional types of aircrafts and I have never seen anything like this. I can not explain what I saw. The only other point of interest is that the light had to be very close to the Idaho National Engineering &amp; Environmental Labratory, site of many nuclear reactors and testing facilities.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  He is a private pilot, and has experience with aircraft.  PD",

It was perfectly quiet and still outside and I scanned the sky as I always do for UFOs and I have done so the past nine years with no results until today. I was facing northeast, then looked up and just overhead and to my right I saw a lumious spheroid shape, moderately bright, white and yellowish-tinged, passing in a straight line from the Santa Barbara Channel in the southeast, to the northeast towards Bakersfield. It travelled in what seemed to be a course crossing directly over the southern end of town. At first I had to eliminate other possibilities: airplane, satellite, meteorite, space station, etc. I felt that it was too low to be in space and it was silent, so it couldn't be a plane of any kind. Also the light itself was too round and uniform in shape, and too yellowish in luminescence, from the point when it was over my right shoulder to the time I watched it disappear over the horizon of the mountains. A conventional space vehicle or satellite would show bright white and gradually either brighten or dim out as it crossed the terminator. This did neither. This thing was just too big and yellow anyway and did not change much in luminosity. It was just too big to be either a marker light or a landing light of any kind and it was not on any established airways. I estimate that it was at somewhere around 30,000 feet give or take a few thousand and the light was easily the size of an airliner. I also rule out any natural phenomena such as meteors. There was no flaming tail and no streaking. It was just not that fast either. It cruised along at a fairly brisk pace which I would estimate at a up to 300 hundred miles per hour. But it was high enough for me to watch it for at least two minutes. I noticed no fluctuations in its course, but it did seem to fluctuate in speed and altitude slightly. I am extremely careful about such things and this is my first report in nine years of sky-w! atching. I feel I have a good sense of such objects from being a private pilot and having spent four years in the Air Force. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I am about 90% sure it was not of this world, but am open to other explanations.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Left a trail, Changed ColoUFO 1/10 of a mile away seen for 10 minutes in Scappoose, Oregon\n\r\nI was driving northbound on Highway 30 from Portland, Oregon to Astoria, through a small town called Scappoose at approximately 9:45pm on Saturday, May 12, 2001.  (There's really not all that much to describe about Scappoose other than the fact that it, like my hometown, Astoria, sits alongside the Columbia River.)  Just out of town, in the sky, I noticed a very bright yellow/white light descending -- straight down and northerly.  I pulled my truck off to the side of the highway so that I could get a better look at it.  My first thought was that it was a meteorite and I was concerned that, because of its speed, size and direction, it was going to hit the Pacific Ocean!  As it got closer, I noticed it wasn't as far away as I had originally thought, so, ever more curious, I got back on the road.  Then it went behind a hill with large pine trees -- or so I thought.  Assuming it was going beyond the horizon, rather than IN the trees, I figured it was just a (REALLY BIG) shooting star and the \u201cshow was over.\u201d  But as I neared the hill, I saw that it had \"morphed\" into an actual \"ship.\"  Bright lights -- ((colors temporarily deleted until investigation is completed)) -- began blinking within the trees and the craft rose straight up out of the trees.  I pulled the car over again, in disbelief, and watched it for a few seconds. It began moving as though it were going to cross the highway, so I got back on the road after two cars drove by.  The craft, wider than the 4-lane highway and approximately 10 feet above the telephone wires (50 feet up), flew directly over the cars.  Both cars\u2019 brake lights came on, but neither stopped!  I sped up, and as it crossed the highway, I anxiously looked for a road to turn down.  I turned east onto a small road, crossed the RR tracks and sped up, all the while keeping my eyes on the craft, which I could see through the trees.  It was now heading south at approximately 20-25 miles per hour. (I want to note that these lights -- ((colors deleted)) -- were blinking very brightly and in an interesting rhythm, but there was no reflection on the actual craft.  Though it was nearly invisible, the best way to describe its shape would be to say ((deleted)), based on the blinking light pattern.  More importantly,  I was able to make out this shape in two previous sightings several months ago in Astoria.  I\u2019m quite certain that this May 12 sighting was the same kind of craft my partner and I have witnessed {she, three times, once with photos; and myself, twice}, based on the light patterns.  They\u2019re very distinctive.) I got out of my truck and watched as the craft stopped and hovered above ((deleted)).  It was approximately 1/10 mile east of me, and 50 feet up. After a few seconds, the lights ((deleted)). There was no sound or movement.  Strangely aware that they knew I was watching, I became frightened, and, legs shaking, got back in the truck, where my usually very active dog was sitting quietly staring in the direction of the craft, and turned west for the highway.  I drove about 20 feet, then stopped when, through my side window, simultaneously, a car pulled up behind me and the craft ((deleted)) -- lights on.  I jumped out of the truck and pointed, yelling, \u201cUFO!\u201d  The ((deleted--people))), got out of their car as well and stood staring at it as the lights became very active -- fast and bright -- and it zoomed off to the ((direction deleted)) (maybe 3 miles?).  It stayed in the same location there -- far up in the sky.  We were all understandably excited, yelling, \u201cUFO!\u201d  \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d  The man said, \u201cI was in the ((government)) for years and that was no plane!  It wasn\u2019t a helicopter either -- I\u2019ve never seen anything like that!\u201d  He said they had just driven past the location of the craft where I saw it hovering, but hadn\u2019t seen it. Directly below it was, as he said, \u201cA big herd of cattle.\u201d Just then, with the original craft in a stationary position in the distant east sky (lights still blinking), another very bright white light appeared from the southeast and flew very fast in a northwesterly direction.  I said, \u201cNow what\u2019s that?!\u201d  The man said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve sent a plane out to check it out.\u201d  I replied, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a military base around here, is there?\u201d  As I said it, he yelled, \u201cThat ain\u2019t no plane!\u201d  I turned to see it that it had stopped abruptly behind a cloud.  Lights flashed and reflected in the cloud, and it shot straight up, with a trail of light behind it, and disappeared. The show was over.  Without even thinking to get their names or give them mine, we got in our cars and drove off.  I can only hope that they may be doing the same thing at this moment -- reporting the incident -- so that we can connect and relay more details to this amazing account. (NOTE:  The ((deleted)) had very ((deleted)) ((deleted)) hair which he had ((deleted)) -- I had the most interaction with him.  The woman, I think had shoulder length ((deleted)) hair.  There was a little ((deleted)) inbetween them in the front seat -- about ((deleted)) years old.  The car, as I remember, was a grey 1990\u2019s ((deleted))?  They left me and headed south on Highway 30, apparently to make sure the ((deleted))\u201d was OK.)\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally credible witness.  Her description of the incident was quite detailed, and we suspect the description above is quite accurate.  Deleted passages will be restored, once an investigation is completed.  We have deleted certain passages to protect the identities of the other witnesses, who are thought to be residents of this small town, and also to protect certain aspects of the sighting, so that future reports will be factual and objective, not just repeats of the original report.  We deem this to be a very interesting report.  PD",

The husband stated that he saw a light which appeared low in the woods behind the house. The wife went into the kitchen where she could get a better look but saw nothing. She then went into the living room, and opened the sliding glass door which exits to the back of the house. Within seconds of opening the doors, a large diamond shaped object appeared from over the house, and continued to move as it passed over the trees in the back woods. The object moved fast and steadily, as it passed about 150 feet overhead. The object was observed for about 8 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to vanish above the tree line. The object which was viewd from underneath, was described as a large solidly outlined diamond shaped object which made a humming sound as it passed over. At each corner, there was a dim white non-blinking light. In the bottom center of the object, was a flat red non-blinking light. Immediately after the sighting, the witness and her husband drove towards the area where the object had disappeared, but nothing was seen. The witness reported feeling nervous and could not sleep well for a couple of days after the incident. The witness also mentioned that every night for a month prior to the sighting, she had been feeding several raccoons which came from the woods. The night of the sighting was the first night which they did not appear, however they did return the next evening. I interviewed the witness the day after the sighting.

It was a fireball that left a tail, perhaps only as an after image. The object seemed large and moved out of the east sky going west into the treeline in front of Spectacle Lake in Bay Mills Township, Michigan. It was incredibly fast. It's not unusual for me to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning, but I don't usually pull the blinds aside to look out the window. For a few seconds,  I kept looking looking to see if there would be more, but there wasn't, so I lay back down and looked at the clock; it was 3:33 a.m. It was impossible to see where it went down, if it did, because of the treeline across the street in a very rural area. Behind the treeline there is a small lake, Spectacle Lake, and behind the lake there is a very large ridge called Mission Hill. Fireball sightings are common here. It is said they are looking out for us. Also, it is common for women to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning.

On the night in particular we turned off the lights pretending to go to bed but stayed quietly inside observing out the windows. At around 3:30am we began to hear the hum, but then it changed into the sound of a small aircraft. I then observed white lights just above the trees at the side of the house circling over the tree-tops. It made at least 6 circles. We then opened the back door to look at the 'airplane' when it suddenly turned on very bright white lights and slowly moved toward the back behind our home and went down about 2 blocks behind us in the neighborhood. It later appeared to approach our house from the back direction when it suddenly began flashing lights all over the craft and turned slightly to my left and came down at a house on our street about 1 block away. At approximately 5am I had gone to bed but the other 2 witnesses observed the craft right over our house, it was straight above their heads, then it appeared to go straight up until it looked like just another star. It was a black cylinder shape with two round appendeges on either side which appeared to rotate with lights on them. The back end of the cylinder appeared to open and close with the thrumming of the sound and when open the inside could only be described as having 'liquid' light. We got a camcorder the next day, and saw it that night but at a distance and attempted to capture it on video, and though it doesn't look like a normal aircraft the video isn't that definative.

Lying on lawn chairs facing skyward, the night sky was filled by hundreds of shooting stars; As the night wore on, the stars increased dramatically. My wife screamed, \"Oh my God, the North Star is falling,\" looking in the direction her face was frozen, I sited what appeared to be a meteror blaseing through Earth's atmosphere; a tear drop trail of flame trailing behind. After entering Earth's atmosphere the glowing meteror landed at approximately 20,000' above Earth's surface, the glow dimmed, and the meteor began a slow desent, at what appeared to be 30-50 mile north of our position. Perhaps, above the remote area of Coperopolis, California. The meteor did not touch down, however it ignited several thousand acres of grass fires, in the range land around Coperopolis, which burned for weeks following the siteing. The meteror became what appeared to be the landing light of an approaching aircraft, flying staight ahead south, while sweaping east to west. At approximatelt 1-mile north of our position, my wife and I tossed all reason out the window, and agreed to remain still, as the UFO approached at approximately, 4-feet below our eve line, rising approximately 20' above the eve line. The craft passed at appoximately .5 to 1 mph, as it approached there was no sound, however, the earth shook erouptly. The approximately 200' craft passed slowly, at a snails pace. Approximately, 1/4-mile straight ahead south the craft arived over the Stansilaus river, at which time it bolted skyward, without a soud, at the speed of light.

It was round and bright but too low to be a star and seemed to be following the highway. It was no chopper or plane becaused it was sphere shaped. The following day it appeared again and spotted by several people at the park and ride.  The following day expecting another sighting of the sphere my uncle grabbed his binoculars to get a close up view.  What he saw was bright orb surrounded by a outer layer of of some sort like the way and ameoba looks under a microscope.  As hit traveled down the highway the outer layers moved around like water ripples.  I don't know if this is  extraterrestial or not but it is defitely wierd I am going to check it out and see it for my self as it has been spotted four days already by several people. Im going to take a digital camera to get some shots. Only problem is it is only seen like at 4:30 in the moring and its hard for me to wake up that early even for a ufo spotting and with my luck I will show up with a digital and the sphere will not appear that day.more to come hopefully",

The look simular to a star, moving up in space and some actually looking like they land on a large star and exit from this star. I observ air craft going over and it is obvious that the objects we are seeing are in space, not in our atmospher. They travel straight, then they sometimes stop, then move sideways and usually come from or go to or travel by that bright star. We have observed shoting stars while seeing the objects, and actually watched one as it passed in front of the bright star. Looking thru the telescope, objects appear to be a bright light, with a light hugh of red lights around it, not noticable with out the telescope. Objects also seem to make turn around trips to this bright star. I am 36 years old, My husband is 49, My daughter is 20, All of us have watched this for the past 4 nights around the same time. I have never seen anything like this in my life and really want to know what this is, and hope this is being seen by others. I was not a believer before this, NOW I AM.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We do not know what the witnesses are observing, but we note that a part of their description of the multiple objects is fully consistent with satellites.  The time they indicate is compatible with the sighting of orbiting satellites.  PD",

It was then I could see the object had shape and a white glow. It made another sharp turn without banking and now was flying due south. The object never made noise and had allmost a wobbly, eratic way of flying,though it flew quite fast. I watched the object fly south for what I judged was about three miles when it did a 360 degree turn without banking or slowing down and came back over me.

At first glance it looked to be a plane, but as I thought about it, it was flying abnormally low for the location.  It was just above the treeline.  I had my friend stop the car and turn around to get a better look.  We both looked at each other and mentioned that it definitely was NOT a plane.  It wasn't really \"flying\" but more like hovering at a slow pace.  We couldnt really see the object well itself because it was dark, but the lights helped to outline it.  It looked to be triangular, with lights on each point.  Not like a plane would be with lights on the wingspan and tail but more like a stealth bomber would look like.  (I suppose it could have been a stealth bomber aside from the odd location it was in and its slow hovering.)  We watched it untill it dissapeared behind some tall trees and we went home.  I know that helicopters can hover...but I am 100% sure that it was not a helicopter. My friend and I told our friends about what we saw and it was nother really more than a weird story, little thought about afterwards.  Untill around two weeks later, two of my other friends told me that they saw the same object that I had described.  They said that they saw a triangular shaped object hovering abnormally low at about the same time of night (2-3am) and at the exactly same location!  They drove closer to the object for a few minutes observing it more.  As they drove home they said that the object was following them.  They said that they'd drive for awhile, look up, and the object wasnt far from behind them.  Although it prob wasnt actually \"following\" them more than it was just travelling in their general direction. These were the only two sightings of this UFO that I know of.  They occured in about a two week inveral in August of 2000.  I have no idea of the exact dates.  I thought it was definitely strange that two different groups saw the same thing, at the same time of day, at the same location.  I don't know how credible the story is since the only sightings that I know of were by me and friends of mine.  Maybe other pople saw it too, but i have no way of knowing.  All I know is that I myself, or my friends weren't lying or extending the truth.  I forgot to mention that the object wasn't making any noise either that I could hear.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

But for some reason the boy did not see it. I did not mention anything to him as to scare him. But you definatly could not miss it. We went into the store no one said a thing. This ufo was just about as big as the strip mall and the strip mall is about 500 to 600 ft long. when we got out of the store it was gone.

At first we thought it was a plane or helicopter, then we realized that if it were either one, we would of heard the sound of the engine or the spinning of the copter blades. Another thing that we noticed was the size of this thing. It was \"HUGE\". because at that distance, it covered the roof tops of a few buildings. The best estimate we can give, is that it was probably the lenght of two football feilds, but we may be a little off. Anyway after 6 minutes or so, we heard a loud sound approchaing from behind us, when we looked up there were four airforce or army jets heading the the direction of the craft. When the jets got closer to the craft, it moved away slowly and faded out of site and It was a pretty clear night. no clouds in the sky.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We don't know what it was the witnesses observed, but we would want to rule out a blimp as the first step in any investigation.

Me and my friend had just gotten back to his house on Ireland Road near route 86 in Hartsgrove from an evening out with some friends.  Instead of turning in for the night we decided to shoot the breeze for a while because the weather was so nice.  So after a while of sitting in my car talking we noticed a strange light in the east sky.  It seemed to be off in the horizon moving steadily closer and higher into the sky.  It was such an odd looking light, it was so bright but it's light seemed so artificial so unlike that of a star.  That is what initially got us out of  my car to go investigate what we were seeing.  As we watched we noticed that it seemed to be moving about the sky in small figure eight configurations all the time while changing the intensity of it's light. After a while of watching the strange light do the same thing over and over again we lost interst and went back to talking.  Then about twenty minutes later in the north sky we noticed a weird looking craft in the sky, it was a rather wide looking object that made no noise, was pitch black in appearance, and only had three lights on it (one red light on each end and a blue light right in the center of it.)  If it was an airplane it was one neither of us had ever seen before.  About ten minutes later there was a huge flash of white light down the center of the sky and the aircraft that was on our left side (south) was now on the right of us.  Other than the fog that had rolled in just before the flash of light it was a perfectly clear night.  So to say the least we were pretty freaked out. Now this is the really freaky part of our night.  We were still in my friend's front yard talking about the weird stuff that was going on, not thinking too much into the events that had all happened within an hour and a half.  Like I said we were in his front yard just talking, we were facing towards each other, and I was looking at the ground kicking at some dandelions.  All of a sudden the ground got brighter like someone was shining a spotlight at us.  When I looked up over my left shoulder into the south sky I saw a perfectly round, perfectly white light floating down out of the sky right at us without giving off a single sound.  It was so bright I had to shield my eyes as I tried to look at it.  I was so stunned all I could do was yell, \"What the hell is that?!\" to my friend.  As I got to \"hell\" the ball of light stopped on a dime not more than forty feet away from us and immediatly shrunk in size, hovered for a brief second, and shot straight up into the sky with such amazing speed.  We watched it as it traveled among the stars until we lost track of it because it was moving so fast and blended in so well with the stars.  It was at that time that I turned to my friend and said, \"I think it's time I go home and go to bed  now.\"  And that's it, that was my one of a few strange sightings in Hartsgrove township.",

It was moving slowly. WE watched it for a few minutes before I told the rest of the family to look at it.  When they saw it, My aunt started running and screaming, Finally it looked as though it dissappeared. Okay we went into the screened porch area, and sat around and talked about it for about an hour or so, and then my son looked out in the sky and there it was again, except this time it was four round balls of light, the same color,but this time it had formed like a triangle shape in the sky. Several people passing on highway 165 south traveling north saw it because they all started sliding on brakes. The Sheriffs department was called about it, but I don't think they believed us.\n\r\n((QUERY))\n\r\n\"Peter B.

It looked like a small airplane was in the sky with landing lights on. Location South of Famington Road by like 5-20 Miles and South of the hills in the back ground before hillsboro metro. (Say go left for 10 mi. from Farmington at 210th) As I saw it I told him I thought it was a plane and went back to watching the show. THEN, he said oh my god look at that, THAT IS NOT A PLANE! I looked and saw the light suddenly get wider in the sky like 10 airplane landing lights side by side and it was at like a 25 degree angle in the sky! It was flashing as bright as an arc welder and looking like a giant crack in the sky with an arc welder showing through from behind! Then it got small and dim once again. Then it faded out and came on in an area that was across the sky and this time had a dim red light that pulsed dim then bright. It was moving very slowly towards the original spot and then it kinda started to glow brighter and the red light faded and it kept repeating this dimming out of site on a clear starry night and then appearing in another spot and then flashing very brightly not like any thing you have ever seen in the air. Like sparks in an arc welder at say maybe 2000 feet. I ran for my video cam and started to film what this light was doing as it seemed to have a kinda revolving black circle or spot that went around it and the whole thing started to change colors like a lava lamp of rainbow colors very bright. At sdome points the lights were almost to bright to look directly at. This whole color thing lasted for only a short few seconds, but made us all gasp as did the bright welding flashes. I said enough and ran for the van with my cam. I went out to Farmington at about 206th and started West. I stopped after turning left onto a side road. I could see it about 5 miles away between me and the hillside. It was not just blinking kinda red and looked a lot like a helicopters lights but made no sound on this very quiet country road. Suddenly as I pulled over up the road (I thought I still had the cam on stand bye but I later found I was too shocked to hit start button.) I stopped to see a better cam shot and it pointed a direct red light more in my direction that looked sort of directional. Then it let got dim white and let out a very bright! white b urst of light that made me gasp! I went on but couldn't get closer and finally lost it among the skyline.

I don't recall any words being exchanged, just all of us staring at the sky, slightly from south to north.  The UFO was circular with a yellowish color, about the size of a full moon and was completely silent.  I could not make out any surface details.  The object seemed to be just a circular light.  It flew westward until it disappeared from sight, appearing to fly over Calexico, California, which is a border town next to Mexicali.  The object was not moving too fast.  Also, there was 2 or three (I can't remember) jet airplanes \"tailing\" it. The sighting was so spectacular that we kept checking the television &amp; radio for any mention of the event, but we never caught any mention of it.  Strangely, we were not in an isolated part of the city and still none of the neigbors mentioned anything.  It was summer and lots of people were usually outdoors.  I guess we became hesitant to mention it to others since we were just kids (I was around 10 years old &amp; the oldest of my cousins only about 3 years older).  My cousins still remember the event.

I was chatting with one of my co-workers, and I happened to glance to my left. A large, bright green ball of light with a green \"tail\" streaked across the sky at a very fast pace, moving downwards at a steep angle. It looked to me as though the ball would crash into the college campus located about 1/4 of a mile east up the road. I asked my co-worker if she had also seen the light, and she said that she had, but only for a few seconds. I kept waiting for the resounding crash that I was sure was coming when the \"craft\" would hit the earth, but I heard nothing. Initially, I thought it may have been a plane that was in some sort of trouble, but then, after I got on the bus, and my co-worker and I talked more about it, I realized that it might not have been just a plane. It made no noise whatsoever, and from where we were standing, it was not that far away that we wouldn't have heard the roar of the engine if it were a plane.

My sister and I saw this one evening while I was baby sitting her when my parents where working that evening.  I'm a bit worried because I reported this when we saw it, and was warned off saying anything else about the event.  Being quite young I of course followed orders - I was somewhat scared of these people.  However, I recently moved elsewhere in the UK and in this area there was a UFO flap during January -March.  I saw a couple of the light shows recently, and called the local coastal radar station to ask what these low flying lights might be, and through the phone call had a visit from the MOD. It seems I'm on file even after all this time, and I do not like the idea of being considered public property by certain government departments. I wouldn't mind so much if I had led an unusual or eventful life, but I'm just a middle aged house wife who seems to have a file with the government? We were sat in the living room of my mothers home which has windows over looking both the rear and front gardens.  I'm sure of the time because we had just finished watching a TV program that finished at 8.30.  My sister saw a strange light in the back that she described as like a glittering ball of light a bit bigger than a tennis ball.  She saw this in our neighbours garden and it seemed to be hopping around the plants and hedges.  (I got the full description after the event I am about to relate.) My sister told me she'd seen something odd in our neighbours garden, and she thought that perhaps his hedge was on fire.  I got up to go to the window to take a closer look, and i couldn't see what she had seen, but as we stood together a huge cluster of lights descended from the sky towards us. The lights were a blue/green in colour and looked like a cross section of a craft.  The lights came towards us a tremendous speed. We ran from the house thinking some kind of aircraft was about to crash on us, and as we stood on the front path wondering why we were still alive a black triangular shaped craft covered in a multitude of different coloured lights flew slowy over us.  If there had been enough room for it to land I'm sure it would have done.  In the meantime a commercial aircraft heading towards Manchester International Airport came into view and the craft took off after it and seemed to be playing tag with it all the way to the airprort.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectThree frightened students and a teacher see a most unusual sight in the night sky...\n\r\nI am a music teacher.  I was with three of my students in my car after a long vocal recording session.  Two youngsters were in the back seat, one was seated up front. It was approximately 10:20pm, we were just leaving the recording studio, which is located in the back yard of a private resident.  I pulled my car forward and was about to make a U-turn when I saw a large object moving slowly South, in the sky, just over a large tree.  It had one light on the belly of the craft, which illuminated the bottom.  It appeared to be a light gray metallic color.  The shape of the craft appeared to be triangular, however, we could not see the top.  It was in close proximity though, because we could clearly see the color, and a metallic reflection from the light. I stopped the car and pointed out this low flying craft to my students.  We all thought it was a military vessel because of how big it was, and, we were about fifteen miles away from McClullan Air Force Base. However, one of my students commented on how slowly it was moving.  It appeared as though it was just hovering, because it moved so slowly.  I shut off the motor of my car and rolled down my window.  This is when my students became agitated.  There was no sound whatsoever.  Then the craft went beneath the tree line quite suddenly. My students became very nervous and asked me to re-start the car and begin our trip home.  The car started fine.  We all continued to gaze at the large tree as I cirlcled the car in the opposite direction.  It was when I stopped gazing, and put my eyes back on the road that I heard my students cry out, for the craft had re-appeared and was moving much faster now.  I stopped the car to watch.  It was indeed moving faster, and in the same direction. One of the kids started to cry, and become almost hysterical, yelling out  \"Go, Go!\".  I turned my eyes back to the raod and hit the trottle.  All three cried out again, almost shrieking, because the craft had shot straight up in the sky and disappeared.  I did not see this however, but by the pale faces of the kids, and the tears welling up in one child's eyes, I didn't doubt for a moment what had happened. The kids begged me to drive faster to get home, all the while, keeping a fixed eye out the back window. I am not an expert, nor amateur in military or commercial craft, and neither are the kids.  It could have very well been something that could have been identified.  But, for a craft to suddenly move straight up and disappear seems brow raising. What is also interesting, is that the kids have not spoken a word of this to any of their friends.  I asked why, they stated that it scares them too much to talk about it.  Well, I suppose you can blame that on too much tv and movie influence, I just don't know. All I do know, is what we all saw that night, and how frightened the kids were...yes, I was a bit nervous myself.  I know the kids and I won't forget this experience either. I personally would like to know what it was.  If this sounds like a common craft, I would like to be told what it is, so I can tell the kids.",

We were traveling in a northwestern direction near the south Georgia border around 8:15 PM, when I looked out the window at the clear blue sky and at about 2 o'clock, about 2000 feet above us, suddenly appeared a very bright light. It seemed to be stationary and several thousand feet away, I watched it for about about 3 minutes. It did not move in relationship with our aircraft. I had unbuckled my seat belt to get a better look when the stewardess told me to refasten my belt. In that brief moment that I looked at the stewardess and then looked back out the window, the UFO had disappeared. At 8:22 it reappeared about 50 to 100 miles away! It was much smaller now, very close to the horizion and I could see that it was moving very fast, it was not leaving a vapor trail but it was still glowing very bright. We were coming up on a thunderhead and our flight went to the left of it. The UFO went to the right of the thunderhead at 8:25 PM. When we got around it the UFO was gone and I never saw it again. At 8:30 PM another airliner passed about 2000 feet below us, this winged aircraft was plainly visible and not the same type of craft I had just witnessed.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>One of several sighting reports submitted by same source.

Once outside we both witnessed six objects in the sky.  They were grouped in pairs.  There were 4 lights, 3 in front-almost in a row-and one in back, forming a triangle shape on the object.  The light in back was  red-the three in front were white-appearing a bit yellowish-blinking in sequence from left to right.  They were lower in the sky than the stars and lower than most airplanes, moving quite rapidly.  When one object would blink another object would blink back.  One pair flew directly over our heads.  This is when we saw the most detail as discribed above.  The three pairs were spaced in three different directions in the sky all flying in approximately the same direction.  They then disappeared.

I then thought the light must be a planet because it was so bright. I was marvelling at the brightness of the light when it all of the sudden became less and less bright until I couldn't see it. I was astonished and speechless. I pulled over to the side of the street in a parking spot. Not many people were around and there was only the occaisional taxi that was driving people home for the night. The light then came back on and was in the exact same spot as before. I scanned the same region of the sky and found what seemed to be three more stars of less brightness. For three minutes all the lights stayed in place. Then some of the lesser lights moved around at astonishing speeds as the very bright light stayed in place. It was like fireflies in the sky. Then the lesser lights stopped on dimes in the sky and remained still. They appeared to be elevated about 7500 ft to 10000 ft in the sky. It was hard to tell how large the craft or lights were. I was a little spooked by this and went to get a coffee around 2 a.m. in the morning. After getting out of the coffee shop around 3 a.m. the lights were still in sky. Every so often the lights would blink out and I could not see them. Then as soon as I thought they were gone they would reappear in the same vicinity. At one point three lights (the bright light along with two less bright lights) seemed to form a triangular formation. I was blown away by how still these lights were. The last time I saw the lights was at dawn over the Yarmouth Harbour. I will never forget this event during my lifetime.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectFootball-field-sized, soundless, rectangular object with lights on bottom, over northeastern Massachusetts\n\r\nI was driving back to Chelmsford MA from Lawrence MA with a friend.  It was approximately 00:30 on a summer evening in 1982.  We were heading south on Rte 495.  There was a normal amount of light traffic for this area and time of evening.  We both saw an unusual light in the sky, far off.  It was obviously not a star (too large and too yellow) and not a street or highway lamp (we could see others) and it was moving towards us.  I believe it was in the sky on the driver's side of the car.  It was not alarming, but continued observation for several minutes piqued our curiosity, because it was clearly moving, becoming larger in our sight.  It was kind of a feeling like, \"what the hell *is* that?\" I remember that we reached a point of wanting to stop the car and observe it for a while.  It moved to a position where it was too high over us for me to see and I began looking for an exit to get off the highway so we observe.  My friend, during this time, had been craning his neck to look up through the windshield to keep track of the thing.  Finally, he leaned way out of the window and looked over the car.  He was in this position when I took the next exit, which I believe took us to a little-traveled portion of Rte 110.  I heard him exclaiming like, \"whoah!\" out the window.  Almost immediately, I stopped the car on the side of the road and we got out.  I remember that it was extraordinarily, strangely quiet -- I mean, no other cars, no activity evident in the nearby houses.  I looked up, and the thing was right above us.  I'm bad a judging size and distance, but it was an enormous platform-looking thing to me with lights (I don't remember the color or if there was any flashing) on the bottom, mainly around the perimeter, I think -- I vaguely remember seeing the edges as darker than the light-polluted sky.  Because it was a good 200 to 600 feet up (I really don't know), the rest of it was dark, and the sky was dark, I got the impression, from the lights, that it was rectangular, although my friend later said t! hat he t hought it was diamond shaped.  Anyway, the thing appeared to be immense, like the size of a football field, or maybe 75% of that, I don't know.  A feeling of shocklike amazement hit me immediately, because something like this simply was not in my experience, which may help explain why I couldn't judge its size or height in better than the general terms given.  I felt transfixed (not by any outside force, but by surprise and emotion).  I glanced around, expecting to see cars stopped on the road and people hanging out of every window, gazing in awe and perhaps panicking at the sight of this thing, but there was no one, no disturbance whatsoever, no cars passing on the nearby tressel.  The object made no sound at all.  I remember standing there, staring up at it with my friend, just staring for another ten or twenty seconds, and it started to move away from us, just a bit, slowly -- then suddenly it accelerrated at an alarming speed (I don't know if it was an \"impossible\" speed, but it was not like anything I'd ever seen), I mean, it just zipped away.  We seemed to be able to continue to observe it as an indistinct light, as we had seen it at first, for a while, but then it was gone.  We were left stunned.  One of the most amazing parts of the experience was that I felt no real desire to speak to anyone about it the next day or thereafter.  My friend told me he had felt the same.  Even now, when I mention it, feeling that I had told so-and-so about it before, long ago, they say I didn't.  It's a bit weird.  My friend and I discussed it only once or twice thereafter -- this is how I found out that he thought it was diamond shaped, while I had thought it was rectangular.  He concurred with my \"football-field-sized\" description, to my recollection.  Very, very strange.  I've never seen anything like it since, and I am unaware of other UFO reports like it.  I have no doubt that it happened, though.  I have never used drugs, by the way, and have never in my life been drunk.  Although I had thought once or twice ! about do ing so in the past, I have never reported this to anyone unknown to me.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I thought that I would open the small upstairs bathroom window which faces West and see if I could spot what was going on. I stuck my head out the window for about 3 minutes or so, looked around, and then I suddenly saw one fairly large orange light which was illuminated for about 2 seconds, then went out. Imediately after that, a second one appeared closely to the left of it (from my view) and repeated the same thing. You could still see a dim halo of the first one, so it seemed as though the lights were paired together. The object/s were dead silent and completely stationary in the sky. I would have estimated that they were 5-10 miles away.  I yelled to my wife and son so they could hopefully witness this. We watched out the window for another 10 minutes or so and didn't see a thing. My son became quite frightened because he knew I was not kidding. The jets seemed to be continually cirlcling around overhead while this was happening, almost as if they too were trying to identify the objects. For about another half hour we could still hear the jets, so I thought I would look again. This time I chose to open and look out my son's bedroom window which also faces west. Now it is about 10:35, and this time a total of four large orange lights had flashed and went out in about a 3-4 second duration. I yelled for my wife and son once again, and only my wife was able to witness a second sequence of flashing orange lights. This time it appeared to be two pairs of lights equally spaced between one another. We were all quite excited about this and contemplated notifying the local police to see if anyone else had witnessed this. Shortly after the second sighting, the sounds of the jets suspiciously went away. Hopefully someone else out there witnessed this and can file their report. It shure was strange but fantastic.",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around objectSighting over Bangalore, India\n\r\nOn The night of Sunday, 13th May 2001, I was with my friend who is an amateur astronomer.  All evening he had been explaining to me about constellations.  It was a clear moonless night.  There were no clouds and the stars were very clear.  At about 23.00 hrs we went up to the roof of my house to see the sky.  My friend was showing me the constellations Scorpio and the Great Bear.  We were facing North at around 23.15 hrs when suddenly we saw an object in the sky right above our heads.  It was as huge as as an aeroplane as normally viewed from the ground.  We do not know when it actually appeared in the sky before we saw it.  The object was brown in colour, moving gently and steadily across the sky from south to north.  It seemed like it was sailing in the sky.  There was no sound or lights emanating from it.  What was clearly visible was that it had a honeycomb like structure (as if it was made up of many similar cell like components).  It was almost T-shaped with a long tail.  The horizontal of the 'T' formed the front of the object. There was a haze around it.  It seemed to be surrounded by some form of energy field or flux which looked like the object was in a fluid like state.  The whole object and the surrounding flux was shimmering as it sailed past (the shimmering was similar to the view one gets when looking at something through the gases emanting from the exhaust of an aircraft just before take of or when one looks at the horizon on a hot day). Within about 5 secs from when we first saw it, the object suddenly faded out of view as if went into an invisible mode. The size of the object was the same visually when it faded away as when we first saw. It did not diminish in size. My friend and I then sat down to explore all possible explanations for the phenomenon and when we were convinced that it was a alien craft, we decided to call the office of the city's largest daily on the night of Monday, 14th May to inform them about the sighting. They were least interested in the sighting. We immediately sat down to record all that we could remember about the sighting. I have tried my best to give a graphic representation of the sighting. The .jpg file shows what the object looked like. In the gif animation I have tried to show the shimering nature. The flash file shows how it looked as it sailed past and how it faded away right before our eyes. Also enclosed is a map of Bangalore city and its location in the Southern India. What was really surprisng was on the morning of 15th May, the dailies all over India carried news articles about this strange mysterious ape like creature with robotic features that was sighted in Delhi. This creature has apparently attacked and injured more than hundred people over the last few days. (The first of these attacks started on April 8th, 2001 at Ghaziabad, India). Though none of the victims have been fatally wounded, there have been two deaths reported where one the victims reportedly jumped off the building while trying to escape the creature and the other, a pregnant woman tripped on the stairs and sustained fatal injuries on her head in the fall. All other victims carry abrasions on their hands, face and legs. Some have even commplained of their toes being bitten off. Reports of the appearance and capabilities of the creature vary slightly from person to person. Some have reported that the creature can jump to great heights when chased. It has been able to move at phenomnal speeds. There are also reports that simultaneous attacks have occurred at different places giving rise to the suspicion that there may be more than one of its kind around. The lastest sighting of the creature as of May 22nd, 2001 is that it has been spooted in the sate of Rajasthan to the west of India. The police initally suspected aliens but for some reason known only to them the stopped giving those versions and went on to propound other theories. I am very sure that there is a connection between the our sighting and what is happening at Delhi. That is why we have taken pains to carefully reconstruct the sighting in as detailed a manner as possible.

I was driving the Quad and my friend on the back seemed to be shocking me with static-like electricity. We both were feeling very odd in a good way. I saw a bright light ahead of me and I stoppped the bike and turned off the ignition. We were hearing very high frequency sounds that would change pitches to sounds I have never heard before. Sounded like the pitch a cricket makes but steady. The sound also sounded like we were under very large power lines. The sound a neon light transformer makes. They were effecting our emotions with the sounds they were making. We felt totally enlighted by these visitors. They were giving our bodies rushes of chills and overflowing feelings of peace. Best feeling either one of us has ever had. They were doing this at will and we were loving it. We stopped 3 more times along the 12 mile road to watch them. Same things happened every time. There were at least 10 of them following us down the road. We were surrounded by them. They also made a very low frequency bass noise too. They were having fun with us. One of them was on our left coming over the hill. A bright white light that we could see approaching through a Palo Verde tree on the hillside. It came closer and closer to about 100 yards away about 120 feet high. Then it went to the right going slow. Behind us were smaller red lights flurrying around like nothing I have ever seen. I feel they know what you are thinking and you can communicate with them. I would ask questions to them in my mind and the answers would come in feelings corrisponding spontaniouslly with the sounds (vibrations) that they would make to us. The second time we stopped I heard and felt a presence behind us about 50 feet on the right. I was not ready to see an alien yet so I did not even look. I just started my bike and took off. This was the most incredible experience my friend and I have ever had. Now he is a believer and I am 100! % convin ced now. We are not alone.",

It was about one in the morning and the campfire was beginning to wane. One of us, I don't remember who, got up to relieve himself. Following the rules we learned in the Boyscouts, our \"head\" was off the island and 100 feet away from the water. It was in a field of large volcanic rocks and sage brush. My friend, not familiar with the Owens Valley, called to us and asked why there were searchlights flashing in the distance. We had no idea what he was talking about so we joined him in the rock field. We saw what was definately beams of artificial light being shined in many directions at once much like a disco ball. The spots of light hit the steep slopes of the Eastern Sierra on our side of the valley and on the White/Inyo Mountains across the valley. We couldn't see the source of the lights because Crater Mountain was directly between our campsite and the light source. Crater Mountain was four miles south of our location, approximately. Whatever the lights were, they were over four miles away and powerful enough to illuminate both sides of the valley. We joked that it was a secret \"Rave\". Others kidded about it being the advanced landing party of the ID4 aliens. In truth, none of us could explain the lights.",

A group of engineers and scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory went to Big Bear Lake for a weekend trip. We had an 8 inch Celestron telescope with a 25 mm eyepiece. We were at a campground west of the lake on a rise. We viewed small aircraft landing at the airport, east of the lake. The sun was behind us and near setting as we watched. The aircraft were landing from south to north, or right to left. With the telescope we could make out the N numbers on the planes. I noticed a few clouds, but the sky was generally clear. The aircraft seemed to be landing in front of a stationary object at some distance to the east. The object was below ten degrees above the horizon. Perhaps four or five planes landed in front of this object, which could have been miles further away. Two other people viewed the object. The object was a long cigar shape. While watching, the object suddenly changed attitude, like a disk tipping and the \"cigar\" appearance became an oval. It then moved away from us and was gone in under a few seconds. It made the impression of a thin metallic disk, seen in profile as a cigar while stationary, and then being seen more rounded as it tipped away from us. There was no sound, lights, exhaust or other features. There were no lenticular clouds in the area or evidence of inversion layers. The temperature was about 65 degrees and there were very light winds.",

As I waited for the jet to fly near the object I noticed that the jet, approximately five to six thousand feet in alltitude, was nowhere near the object. The object seemed miles higher. As we watched the object for several minutes, we questioned what we were looking at and all had the same observation.The craft tipped sideways several times and revealed a oblong saucer shape. One time as we watched, it tipped forward. There also seemed to be a haze of some sort around the object. Only one conflicting observation among the three was made,one of us thought there was a shine to the object. The only thing odd about the object was it just didn't belong there. There was no fear or excitement,no noize of any kind. The sky was perfectly clear not a trace of a cloud. This was not a ballon of any kind,no hellicoptor or plane or planet. We all had plenty of time to watch this object which stood rather still most of the time. It acted like it was watching something.",

I didn't report it at the time, thinking that, somehow, it must be an airplane, but since then I've described it to several aviators and never found one who could make sense of it.  I'm less interested in getting it into the record than in hearing a plausible explanation, if there is one, so I will accept a collect call.  In case my wife or a child doesn't understand the call, and refuses, please try again.  I'm at home evenings. My wife and two of my children saw the object as much as I did, but my wife is not a native speaker, while my children remember the incident but very little about it.  We were sitting in the back yard.  The sky was clear, except a small cloud formation in the north.  The object flew in a straight line from north to south, at low altitude, apparently, and it was absolutely silent.  I'm hard of hearing, but wife and kids said that it made no sound that they could detect.  What we actually saw was four large luminous disks, all the same size, with an appearance similar to fluorescent lamps behind circular plastic shields.  They were quite bright but not dazzling.  Each was a good deal larger than the full moon.  They were facing downward.  They were in a formation as if they were in the same positions as the engines on a 4-engine airplane with a somewhat swept-back wing, and the distance from the leftmost disk to the rightmost was about the distance from tip of thumb to tip of little finger if the hand is held at arm's length with fingers spread as much as possible.  We did not see a wing, body, or anything other than the disks, and I figured this was because we didn't have the time or presence of mind to see them, but I saw two of the disks shift slightly and quickly relative to each other - wife and kids said later that they didn't see that.  This \"airplane\" flew at a go! od clip from north to south, about what I'd expect of a 4-engine airplane at that altitude; I should say, \"all deliberate speed.\"  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, or anything of that nature.  I am sure it wasn't a blimp or dirigible, and I can't see it being a glider, since I have trouble believing that a glider could fly with large disks under its wings, and I'd think such a stunt would be extremely dangerous at night, even if it could fly.  Besides, I've never seen a glider around here.  I really would appreciate it if you could offer me an explanation for what we saw.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

It was very nice outside so I went back in to tell my girlfriend to come out and see a very beautiful nightsky, since we're both avid stargazers. She came out and I went back inside for a few minutes, as I watching TV, she ran in the house to grab the binoculars, saying she's seeing strange lights flying around. She ran in again and told me to hurry up and come out. OK, OK I said to myself, probably a airplane or something. I waited for a commercial to come on and went outside. She excitedly gave me the binoculars and pointed to the direction of these lights. Before raising the binocs to my eyes, I saw a couple of flashes in the distance, low on the horizon maybe 20 to 30 degrees up. As I looked in the glasses, sure enough, a flashing &amp; dancing light, blinking reds, whites and blues. The direction we were looking was a SSE direction from our patio. It was flashing on &amp; off changing colors and moving so erraticly, I knew right away I was seeing something strange, not an airplane, a star, or planet. We're both amature astronomers and look at the nightsky alot, we both never seen anything close to this! My girlfriend had been watching this object for about 10 minutes before me, and I observed this for about 10 minutes myself. The way this light was moving around was so strange, blinking and showing up in a different direction, but staying in 1 general area the whole time we watched it. I strated getting dimmer towards the end and slowly sank below a distant tree and disappeared. We both are clueless on what this was, a definante UFO dancing under a very beautiful Mars and flashing in and around a rising Sagittarius constellation. Just Incredible! I thought about this websight right away since I reported a fireball a few months earlier. Low and behold! Checked the May 2001 reports and saw a report of a light seen in Hillsboro, OR by 3 witnesses on May 20th, word for word described exactly like what we'd seen (on May 26th) We could'nt believe it. They reported having a videotape of their sighting. We don't have any photographic evidence, but sure would like to see their video! Other witnesses said they seen the object in the vicinity of Farmington Road and 210th Ave. Thats the exact area we were seeing our sighting, we're loacted by the area of Minter Bridge and River roads, a couple of miles from Farmington Road.

Here it goes: It was the summer of 99. We were on a remote rural area in eastern Venezuela. It was about one month after we arrived in the area and on a very clear and moonless night. While my friends stayed inside the house having dinner I came out to get something out of the truck, it was very dark and I had to use a flashlight to go outside. While I walked to the truck I noticed that there was a light coming from above, I immediately looked up and saw a round shape object about 200ft wide hovering right on top of the house. It made no sound. I could tell that is was circular because it was covering the stars that were very visible that night. It had a reddish light in the meddle. I immediately called my friends out and we all watched amazed at the craft. One of the girls in the group turned a flash light on and started to make signals to toward the UFO while some others panicked and ran inside, about 10 minutes later the light in the middle became a beam of light that landed right on top of the house, and then a human shaped being floated up and down the beam and seemed to be looking at us, it was impossible to see any details like mouth, nose, etc. because the light was engulfing it, it was also impossible to tell what color it was (it looked dark gray).  After a few minutes it slowly left. The next day we drove in the direction where we thought it had gone and we took a few people from the nearby town so they could guide us trough the very rough terrain. We finally found a large round area where all the grass had died, it wasn't burned, and it was just flat on the ground and dead.",

The speed inwhich it moved ruled out a helicopter and its direction ruled out a satalite as they move with the Earth to the west. We looked through the telescope and saw a pyramid shaped object with four red lights, one on every corner. The object seemed to be rotating as it moved. The rotating increased in speed just before it moved away at a speed which seemed to be very slow although the object became very small very quickly, this leads me to the conclusion that the object was moving at an incredible speed away from us.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around objectA large greenish Orb is sighted near Cedar Grove WI early in the AM 11/20/85 for aprox. 10 minutes by two witnesses\n\r\nMay 27, 2001 To my friend, Peter Davenport I've thought long and hard about whether or not to write this letter to you. Please take the time to read it completely. It's honest and true. Almost 16 years ago (11/20/1985) while on route to a Professional Photography Seminar in Indiana, another Professional Photographer and I witnessed something that I still can't explain to this day. Let me go into detail. We were traveling south on Interstate 43 at approximately 4:15 a.m. near Cedar Grove, Wisconsin (approximately 39 miles north of Milwaukee). I remember making a comment about how black and crystal clear the sky is. I am an amateur astronomer and you tend to notice details about the sky such as (where the moon is, sunrise time, constellations, meteors, etc.). My partner, who was driving, let out a yell (and a few choice words) and told me to look at that thing. I said what thing? He told me to look east toward Lake Michigan. I couldn't believe my eyes. We both saw a greenish glowing orb east toward Lake Michigan. We pulled over quickly on the gravel shoulder of I-43. I looked at my watch and it was now 4:18 a.m. We both got out of the car and just stared at the object. The orb or whatever it was, appeared east from our location at an angle of approximately 45 degrees off the eastern horizon. It was impossible to judge distance given that we had nothing to reference it to (the area is extremely dark with few lights.) We were approx. 2 miles west of Lake Michigan. The size of the object was difficult to ascertain given the lack of reference. I, however, did a simple comparison that gave me some sort of repeatable ratio to the object. I held my arm straight out fully extended toward the object and made a tight fist to reference the size of my fist to the object. The object was almost the same size as my closed fist at arm's length. The time that the object remained at this size was about four minutes. During this period of time, the orb didn't seem to move or change in brightness or color. It remained clearly round and had a definite diffused greenish glow to it. After this period of time (approximately 4 minutes), the object did a strange thing. The object began to i! ncrease rapidly in size I did my extended arm test again and this time the object was about the size of an open hand with the fingers fully extended. (At this time, I think we both felt a sense of fear at what we were seeing.) I can only estimate that the object stayed at this size for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. After this time period (approximately 8 minutes from first seeing the object), the object began to decrease in size and became as before, about the size of a closed fist at arm's length. At about this time, my partner grabbed his camera, and fired off a few frames of film. (Unfortunately, he had only daylight portrait film loaded) Because of the low ISO rating, the film was not sensitive enough to record low light without a tripod and long exposure. The next thing that happened was even stranger. While we both observed the object, it seemed to expand outwardly and de-materialize right in front of our eyes. We both observed the object a total of about (10 Minutes) including the time when we saw it de-materialize. The time according to my watch was now 4:30 AM. I know how crazy this probably sounds to you, but as God as my witness, this event is true. We had to be in Indiana at a Professional Seminar by 8:30 AM so we had to continue on our journey. The following day after the sighting, I called The Center For UFO Studies in Chicago. I have to admit I felt awkward and a bit uneasy calling in about a subject such as this. The man who talked to me was pleasant and asked a lot of questions (such as directions, time, location, clouds, etc.). I answered carefully and honestly as best I could. When I had finished describing what we had seen, he told me that the Center For UFO Studies \"had received three separate reports from three commercial airline pilots who had apparently seen something east of my location at approximately the same time and date.\"   He; however, wouldn't go into detail. I don't use drugs; never have, and never will. I only have an occasional alcoholic beverage. I have a clean record and have never been in trouble with the law. I have never had any mental problems. What I have said is 100% true and honest. Before this sighting, I would have laughed at people who claim to see UFO's. I no longer laugh at this subject. Many rational people have observed unexplainable things in our skies. I, frankly, don't know what we saw that early morning almost 16 years ago. I do know it was not a normal occurrence or imagination. One important thing we did the next day was to make a tape recording with all the information and details still fresh in our minds. I also made several duplicate tapes and have distributed them. I know this sounds paranoid; however, at the time we took this event very seriously. If you need additional information or would like to contact me by telephone please call me collect. My phone number is (920) ((number deleted)) after 5 PM central time week days. I would appreciate it if you would not use my name in your Sightings Data Base. I have not (at this point) contacted the second witness about reporting his sighting to NUFORC thank you for your time ((name deleted)) ((street name deleted)) Sheboygan WI 530XX",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectLow flying craft with 2 huge Lights/Portals near San Franscio, Ca\n\r\nWell, I finally have had my first waking-conscious sighting, and am I excited about it! I saw it on Sunday evening (May 6th) at about 9:30!  I went outside as I do every night to \"check out\" the sky. I sat down and looked across the valley having a wide range of sky to view.....then, I looked straight up! That's when movement of something caught my eye slightly  toward the left (south) of me. 2 huge lights were moving south toward San Francisco away from me! I thought, \"Gee, I didn't know planes had tail lights like that! Gee, that plane is awfully low!  Hey! absolutely NO sound!\"    By now I am very interested!!!!!!  I tried so hard to make this a plane! Yet, no red or blue lights blinking, I couldn't make out the wings either! During the week I have watched the full moon change size as it rises. I would say the size of the moon at about 70 degrees-maybe 60 degrees- above its horizon, is the size of  each of the 2 lights/portals on this craft! That's pretty big!  (I was expecting portals to be about the size of cruise ships portals.) It was difficult to see the body of the craft as it seemed to match the sky. The moon was not up far enough to cast any light on it. I did have the impression the area of the lights was oval and I felt that the outer edges of the circular lights marked the outer edge of the craft. I felt the lights/portals were in the lower \u00bd of the height of the craft.. I could be wrong here...... I also had the impression that the height of it was long. And, above the light section the craft started to get narrow. Maybe my eye caught this, I don't know how I know this. The Height: Now, I am not good at judging heights in the dark, but I will do my best here. I am 700 feet up from the valley floor, oak trees in question are about 60ft. tall, and the branches reach out to about 45 feet. The area I viewed the craft in was: (with one eye shut)one hand from wrist to fingers plus the length of my another hand's fingers. The width of the craft where the portal area was: (with one eye shut)4 palm knuckles across. My guess is that the craft was 1000 feet above me, making the craft large. If the craft was up higher than that, this was a huge craft! Hard to tell for the lights were SO large. When I first went outside apparently the craft was going right over my head! When I noticed it, the craft bottom had already passed me. The brightness of the lights/portals dulled everything else about the craft as well as no moon shining on it. No light was emitted outward from these lights/portals, it was all internal lighting. I had no missing time. During the long 6 to 10 seconds of viewing it and afterward, I felt calm, happy. There was like a gentleness to the craft. What a treat this was for me!!",

In 1991 We, my wife and youngest daughter, purchased a home in the \"Ozarks\", ((town deleted)), Ark. In Sept. ? of 1994 I drove into town to pick-up my daughter, age 6 yrs., and her friend, age 9 yrs. from school. It was 3:00 PM. We drove to \"Red Mule\" for ice-cream, then went straight to the friend of my daughter's home to await her mother, and my wife who were shopping in \"Batesville\" 35 miles distant. The girls played in the front yard and I remained in the truck. At approximatly 3:30 PM. A \"B2\" stealth bomber approached my vehicle at a right angle, and would fly directly over my truck. I hurriedly left the truck for an unobstructed view. This was a first and only phisical view of the B2. It was real low, real slow, real large, real black, and almost noiseless. Imagine my thrill as it lazily passed over me. I turned as it went over, and called the girls to look-up. They did, as they lined to my left. At this time,the B2 was maybe a hundred yards past. Then, the corner of my right eye picked-up the site of a \"silver/metalic disc hurtling down crossways, right to left at about 45 degrees. It looked as though it would contact the \"B2\". In seemingly nothing-flat, the \"disc\" which appeared completely circular on its path downward suddenly flattened in a manuever and positioned itself directly over the canopy section (rearward probably of the windscreen)and at once was in perfect sinc with the direction, and knot-speed of the B2.My daughter's friend exclaimed loudly...AND WHAT IS THAT? I answered, DO YOU SEE THAT? She said YEA! as did my daughter. My mouth was dry, and my neck-hair bristled, or crawled. I was totally confused and riveted to this event. The \"disc\" in reality only hovered over the stealth for maybe 4 or 5 seconds and I strained to take it all in. The sky was 3D clear blue, and the sun was behind me, and to my left. The stealth was now directly moving straight away from us and suddenly there was a blinding yellowish/white fuzzy flash and the \"disc\" ! hurtled away at a withering rate of accelleration, and at a level on par with the \"B2\" and at a 20 to 30 degrees \"port\" angle to the \"B2\"s dead reckoning. Several more seconds elapsed before I thought to \"count\". I then counted about 5 seconds and the \"disc was gone into and beyond the horizon. I switched my stare back to the stealth and to my amazement, it had not pursued,nor altered its heading, nor differentiated in its rate of velocity. As I have so stated; the \"disc\" was of a silver/metalic nature. I had it in my vision extremely clear. There were no portals of any kind. There were no discernable seams,nor rivits although at that distance of probably five hundred feet or more down the road; these features might'nt be visible to the naked eye. There were no lights, nor markings that I could discern. In short, nothing but the superb showing of the silver/metalic skin, and the shape. It was circular, flat bottomed, with a curved, or arched topside and sloping gently towards the bottom edge, yet extending slightly past then curving tightly downward, and inward,and straightening to the bottom edge. End of story. Beginning of mystery. There is a MUFON chapter somewhere near Batesville, Ark. ? A lady doctor fields the calls. I contacted her after my daughter's friends mother took the MUFON contact number from a T.V. U.F.O. show several weeks after our encounter. I related this same account to her, and she advised me that this was a remarkable event that did not occur often. I no longer have her number. As we talked, she advised me that there would in several weeks time be an international mufon gathering in Silver Springs, Ark. I however did not attend, but maybe you have heard of it, or possibly attended. Let me know if you are able to confirm this with any other information. Thankyou. We have moved once again after 1994.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate. PD",

Subsequent investigaton shows cloud ceiling at 9,000 ft. with family estimating altitude of 5,000 feet, with closest approach 85 degrees almost overhead.  Viewed through binoculars by husband and wife, with 378 feet linear diameter field of view @1,000 yards(translating into approx. 7 degrees angular field).  Binocular field of view could not contain the entire triangular object.  That is, husband and wife could NOT see the entire object within the field of view of their binoculars.  Obviously, these witness estimates cannot pinpoint the exact altitude, dimensions, etc. of this object, BUT these are credible witnesses who are able to question their own perceptions.  Investigators on this case, having checked law enforcement, Iowa state climatologist, and FAA, are convinced that whatever was seen was, indeed, \"HUGE,\" and since we cannot easily explain it, it remains in the UFO category. ADDED TO INVESTIGATORS' INTEREST IN THE AMES AREA, are reports of a neighbor to the above family having seen an unexplained aerial object BETWEEN/BESIDE their adjacent homes on a previous occasion. ALSO, the wife witness in the above case had a daytime sighting three years ago near the southwestern part of Ames (this is town of permanent population of around 30,000....student population at Iowa State University obviously swells the population considerably) PLUS, we have been contacted with abduction reports by several individuals in the Ames area - all witnesses thus far check out as highly educated, credible individuals with (as far as we can tell) their \"psychological\" feet on the ground, i.e. not wanting to over-conclude, but realizing that they've been able to remain conscious at least part of the time during encounters involving UFOs. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT - only 7 miles from Ames in 1996, two crop formations were discovered, with plant and soil samples subsequently being submitted to Dr. W. C. Levengood's non-profit laboratory in Michigan, with lab results clearly showing anomalies associated with the formations. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I NOTE THAT someone else from the Ames, Iowa area turned in a report to NUFORC recently, without leaving their name so that they could be contacted by MUFON investigators.  I would like any individuals who are reluctant to report to us to know that MUFON DOES NOT REVEAL WITNESS IDENTITY, unless that witness is willing to be revealed publicly.  We have NO WISH TO EXPLOIT ANYONE!)\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Our gratitude to Bev Trout for submitting the report.  We encourage any other wintesses to the event to contact her directly.  In addition, we would invite other witnesses to submit brief reports to NUFORC, using our Online Report Form.  Thank you.  PD",

One of these was yellowish, moving vertically, one white and stationary, and one of them was white and moving diagonally up, and it blinked three times, than another three before it disappeared.  The only one that didn't do this was SE and very low, moving back and forth behind some trees.  I only see one at a time, so I don't know how many there are. I think this is a regular occurrence, and shall try to keep watching. On a weirder note, the things seem to disappear when I call them to the attention of another person.

It seemed to be going about the same speed across the sky as a satellite, and kept a very straight course.  Eventually, it looked like it was getting even higher (it looked damn high to begin with), until it eventually disappeared from sight.  It was a nice, colorful show.  Can satellites do this?

It was brightly lit (white light) and there were very bright flashing lights (white light) directly underneath which were either rotating or pulsating from different areas underneath... no pattern to flashing. The object was travelling South to North, although at first it seemed to be stationary for about 1 minute or so. It slowly made its way to the horizon and left my field of view. Initially I would estimate it may have been approximately  1 mile beyond my location travelling North. Perhaps this was some sort of military craft, although completely silent. Travis AFB is North of my location... very strange indeed. I only wish I had grabbed my video camera. I was just standing there trying to figure out what I was seeing.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Left a trail, Changed ColoI watched what I thought was an exhaust trail in the sky over Torrance as it moved, changed shape and color in the sky\n\r\nOn Tuesday, May 29, I was driving in the South Bay area of Los Angeles county throught the city of Torrance.  I had driven east on Sepulveda Blvd and turned north onto Madrona (Prairie Ave), traveling north. As I was passing Del Amo Fashion Mall, I casually glanced up at the sky and saw what I first thought was the exhaust trail of a jet plane. I was going to dismiss it but it looked kind of odd. It was white and kind of short and stubby looking, like the plane had just turned on the exhaust.  The shape reminded me of the forked tail of a bird.  The thing that was most unusual was that it appeared to be at an angle that looked like the \"jet\" was diving.  This was an angle of about 60 degrees or more from the horizion.  It was sighted to my left, northwest of where I was driving. I thought it was somewhere near LAX Airport or over the ocean near the airport. Because of that angle, I began to keep my eye on it because it looked like something that was crash-diving.  I thought that it may be a meteor or space junk re-entering the atmosphere but it did not appear to move.  The trail did not get any longer and it did not dissapate.  It did appear that the two tails were merging into one. At this time I looked at my clock and the time was 7:55 PM PDT.  When I noticed that this \"exhaust cloud\" had not moved I paid closer attention because it did not act like a jet or anything leaving an exhaust trail behind.  Then at about 8:00 the exhaust cloud appeared to move!  At first I thought it was an optical illusion since I was still driving so I closed my eyes quickly and then looked back at it and it was moving!  The whole \"cloud\" had began to move! What I thought was the leading end (pointing downward) started to arch around, pulling the whole \"cloud\" with it into a horizontal line!  As it moved it began to glow and changed colors from white to a  bright orange-white line that then remained stationary in the sky glowing orange-white.  At this point I came to a stop light where there were cars ahead of me that cau! sed the view to be obscured.  When we started to move again, this \"line\"  was still horizontal to the ground but it also seemed to be lower in the sky than before.  Unfortunately as I moved toward Hawthorne CA, the houses and trees were more dense so it was more difficult to see this object.  I continued to sight it until I reached the area of Marine Ave and Prairie Ave where it was then obscured by trees and buildings.  I stopped at my home for less than 5 minutes and then tried to spot it again as I drove toward the 105 freeway but I could no longer see the object.  I don't know how it moved away or if it did but it was no longer visible.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectMultiple, star-shaped, dim yellow lights in straight line\n\r\nI saw something unusual very early in the morning on October 19, 1995. I was out back at about 1:00 am, just looking at the stars with my binoculars. There were some light clouds to the south but no moon, so it was fairly dark and quite a few stars were visible, at least for this area. (I live in Colorado Springs, CO, and city lights tend to block the stars.) I was browsing in the area about 5\u00ba north of Capella (about 50\u00ba above the horizon), when some lights came right through my field of view. There were about seven or eight distinct lights, all the same color, a dim yellow. They were shaped like four-pointed stars, all in the same orientation, but not point-to-point. They were in almost a straight line formation, with the line perpendicular to their direction of travel. Two or three of them near the ends were behind the line. They were quite close together, but not in what looked like a normal flight formation--just a group. They were traveling in a straight line, and fairly quickly. My first thought was that some low-flying object had crossed my field of view and was very out of focus, so I quickly tried to focus on the object, but discovered that it was in fact already in focus, and that the lights were really shaped like that. Also, I have very high-quality binoculars, and when lights are out of focus, they don't become star-shaped, they become blurry dots. Just to confirm this, I studied some real airplanes and stars later, adjusting the focus to both extremes. I could not make them look anything like the lights I saw. Furthermore, when I looked at them naked-eye, I could still see the star-shape. The lights traveled from the northeast to the south-southwest, passing almost directly overhead. They traversed about 90\u00ba in about ten seconds, keeping a constant speed, as far as I could tell. Their formation changed slightly; I believe they moved a little closer together, with the ones behind the main line moving a little toward the middle of the line. It's possible, of course, that the apparent change in the formation was just a change in the perspective as they passed, but my impression at the time was that their positions relative to each other did change slightly. I would guess they were no higher than an airliner's cruising altitude, and probably quite a bit lower. I may have the impression they were lower because I could see the shape of the lights (not just pinpoints of light like an airplane), and because they traversed the sky so quickly. If they were higher, they would have been huge and extremely fast. This is possible, of course, but my impression was they were somewhat lower in altitude. On the other hand, I never heard any noise, and if they were a normal aircraft traveling at a normal altitude, I would surely have heard the engines. As they passed overhead, I had to momentarily look down while I turned to face them. Since I knew what to look for and about where they would be in the sky, I found them again naked eye without any trouble. But I realized that they were faint enough that if I had not seen them through the binoculars first, I doubt I would have ever noticed them naked eye. While looking at them naked eye, the line of their formation was about the width of a finger tip at arms length. In trying to figure out what they might have been, I've been trying to eliminate possibilities. I do not believe the light could have been reflected from the sun or earth, because the object or objects were almost directly overhead in the middle of the night. They would have been in Earth's shadow. The moon did not come up for a few more hours, so I don't think they could have been reflecting light from it. It seems they were generating their own light somehow. (Admittedly, though, I may not understand the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the Earth well enough for these assumptions to be correct.) The lights did not appear to be exhaust from rocket engines because of the star-shape and the fact that they did not leave an exhaust trail. They also left no contrail, even though an airplane that flew over just a couple minutes later left a contrail that could be seen for several minutes. I could not see any vehicle or structure connecting the lights. They looked like separate objects. I did not, however, think to look for stars passing between them. The pattern and color of their lights was clearly not that of a conventional aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter (no wingtip lights, the wrong color, and not blinking). Also, they moved too quickly to be an aircraft, unless it was quite low. If it was that low, I would have been able to both hear it and make out its shape. I don't believe it could have been multiple aircraft, first because of the pattern of lights, and nobody but a precision flying team could have been that close together. If it had been a precision flying team, I also would have heard their engines. If they were high enough so I could not hear their engines, they would have been a much smaller formation, and the lights would have been pinpoints, not star-shaped. It was clearly not either a meteor or satellite. If it was a military craft (which we see a lot of around here), it was not heading toward any of the local military installations. In fact, if it was any conventional aircraft, it was not following any of the usual flight patterns we see here. In short, I have not been able to think of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that this could have been.

I was looking at them for at least 30 seconds. They were not a jet or anythng like that because jets dont manouver like that and they dont move that fast either.They must have been some kind of new technology.The first feeling i got was that it was some kind of secret government technology.Either that or it was E.T.",

I happened to look to my left to the north  when I noticed a faint red object slowly moving over the treetops. I noticed the at equal segments there would be small flashes of lightning like light coming from the bottom of craft. I could not believe what I was seeing. I stopped my jeep on the side of the highway and got out of the jeep to get a better look. At this point I still could not believe it. I reached into the jeep and got my handheld floodlight and plugged it in the lighter I pointed it at the object and flashed it a couple of times at the craft and it stopped changed to a faint orange and it flashed three times and changed back to red . I flashed a few times more and the craft matched what I did. then the craft moved on heading west. So I got in the jeep crossed the median to follow it. All of a sudden it just took off straight up at super high speed. I stopped the jeep again got out to look all I could is several starlike objects moving in the western sky and they where gone. I could'nt believe no other cars drove by during this time. So I drove on to Florence. When I got there everyone was angry with me and I could not understand why. then they asked me why was I almost four hours late. All I told them was I had car trouble.

Gradually, lights consistent with airplane were clearly seen, so no big deal.  Then what can only be described as an object of some type was jettisoned from the \"plane\" and floated downward for approx 5 seconds. There was a very clear light trail as it fell and my first thought was that the plane had jettisoned garbage (etc.)...until the falling object stopped, hoevered a moment, then moved laterally for another 5 or seconds and then halted. We had been out with my brother's son earlier with his new telescope and there were very few stars at that time to view (clear night, half moon).  When I left the house, there were more visible stars, but still few on the northern horizon.  I do know there was only one star clearly visible in the area where the plane was flying prior to the object falling.  After that object had taken up position, there were now two stars in the sky. My brother is a former LtJG with the Navy and pulled out binoculars to observe the plane before it peeled off.  His comment: 'I don't recognize the light patterns on the plane' although he has been out for a seven years and things likely have changed. I have no idea how to characterize what we saw, though my first guess is that this is not a UFO per se but a surveillance device of some type.  Time issue: from the time the object dropped, it was about 15 seconds before the plane crossed near us (not directly overhead, but reasonably close).",

The sky was so clear that we could see numerous stars.  Expect there were verticle rays of light, similar to when the sun shines through clouds during the day. These rays were vertically rippling.  When we pulled over they seemed to condense.  We decided to leave (quickly) we pulled over about 1/2hour later and the condensed light seem to still be to the right side of the car.  We when home.  When we got out of the car it was over head.  I got the camera but could not get a picture (wouldn't work), then I got the video camera (would work outside).  My wife took one picture of me looking up when developed two balls of light are above and to the left of my head.  The second picture she took, you can see one of the lights, speeding up going over and around my head and then slowing down and moving to my right ear.  You see the start point and stop point as well as a bright green trail of movement it took.  The trail of movement clearly shows the light speed up /////  /   /   / /  /  /   /   / / ////// and slow down in a curved path.  The second light does a motion left turns right ///// /  /   /   /     /  and is gone.  What scares me is that these are two very organised recognisable paths that these white light took and then one was gone and one is seen beside my ear in the split second that it takes to get a picture.  Our camera would not work shooting upward but did work at a face to face type level.  Behind me is nothing but, forest, which can not be seen in the picture because it was dark (with the exception of the sky).  Off in the distance that night we also saw a verticle bright beem of light going strait up into the sky.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We do not know what the individuals witnessed, but we feel that a laser-based advertising light would have to be ruled out.  They are quite similar in appearance to what the witness has described, but we do not know whether Angus, Ontario, is a populated enough area to warrant the use of dramatic advertising lights.  Moreover, we would not expect an advertising light to be used at 0300 hrs.., since they are very expensive to operate.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, LandedElectric Blue Half dome with possible alient encounter.\n\r\nMy son's interest in this phenomenon rekindled my memory of the incident (which was reported to UFORIC the day after the event). I was around 15 at the time.  My friends and I were camping out in my backyard which is adjacent to a golf course.  As I lay in the tent (my friends were hanging out in the front yard...Hey..I was tired), I noticed a bright electric blue light coming from the golf course area.  Opening the tent, I noticed an object resembling a half dome with a small protusion coming from the top of the dome.  It was oriented like a half moon in a verticle position rather than flat/horizonal.  There also appeared to be a base to the dome, cylindical in shape, attached to the flat side of the dome.  Its diameter was less than that of the dome and was, perhaps, a 1/16 of the overall size of the object (which I estimate was maybe 40-60 ft in diameter). The object moved from east to west over the fairway when I lost site of it at the far end o the fairway. A few minutes later, my friends joined me in the tent and I asked them if they saw it.  They hadn't as the were in the front yard and their view was obstructed (they also weren't paying attention). We all went to sleep. Around 02:00, I remember awakening to relieve myself.  As I climbed out of the tent, I noticed a faint blue glow from the west.  Then, the beam from my flashlight struck something no more than about 20 feet away.  Took me a second to realize I was staring at a person or being.  It stood about 5 feet tall and motionless about 20 feet away just on the other side of a small hedge.  Skin was grayish in color and the eyes were a burnt yellow color.  If it were clothed, it must have been close to the same color as the being. I stood staring at this being for maybe another 10 seconds absolutely stunned.  It then seemed to dive on the ground and I didn't see it get up again.  Thinking my friends were playing a joke, I went to check on them.  They were all asleep in their sleeping bags. I immediately awakened them, and we all got out of the tent, but we did not see the being again. In the morning, we went to see where the faint blue light was coming from.  Not far from my home, there is another golf course that also had an old abandoned iron quarry.  This quarry was, maybe 500 yards from my house.  In the grass of the old quarry, we found evidence that something had flattened the grass and weeds in the old quarry.  I don't recall seeing any indentations (like from landing gear), but the long grass had definitely been packed down in a circular shape. Back in my yard, we noticed something else as well.  Where I said that the being dove on the ground, there was a rough outline of a person in the grass...browned grass when the surrounding grass was green.  The grass was also packed down, slightly, as if something had been there. I told my father what I had seen and he called, I believe, UFORIC.  They dispatched an investigator who took my story, a few photographs of the area, and radiation measurements of where I said the being dove on the ground.  He also used some sort of visual dosimeter as well.  The investigator told us that there were elevated radiation levels in the area of question.  He did not go to where I believe was the landing site. After filing my report, I never heard from the investigator again and pretty much put the event out of my until recently when my oldest son took an interest in \"aliens\" and asked me if I ever saw one (or even a spaceship).  I'm not even sure UFORIC still exists.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I have estimated the date, but know it was about lunch time that day because my mother was making lunch for us.  (I don't know if you care much for childhood memories, but I remember it like it was yesterday.)  We lived on a small farm and our nearest neighbor was about 1/4 mile down the road. I am the oldest of 6 children.  On this summer day we were all outside playing kickball.  I went back to the fence to chase down the ball when a silver flying saucer hovering over my neighbors barn caught my eye.  As soon as I saw it, three legs came out of the underside of the saucer and it floated down to the ground behind our neighbors barn where I assume it landed.  I called all of my brothers and sisters to watch, figuring it would have to take back off again.  While waiting, I ran inside to get my mother, but she dismissed me as a child making up a story and did not care to come see for herself.  I ran back to the fence where my younger brothers were getting bored and had given up on waiting to see it.  Only myself and my two oldest siblings waited long enough (about 15 - 20 minutes) when we did indeed see the craft take off again.  It raised up above the barn, retracted its legs, and shot off over the tree horizon very fast.  The craft was silver with a dome on top and was shaped like a saucer.  It was witnessed in good light during the day and with good weather.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I did not know who to report this to until I found this website and thought it important to report it even at this late date.  What I am not confused about, or my two sons, is what we saw.  We saw one night just before dark between the dates May 19 and May 27 2000, approximately May 23 a very strange circular light traveling in the sky at approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from east northeast to west southwest.  This light appeared diffused, but was obviously at a low level altitude.  The light was mostly white to pink in color and very odd.  Having been raised one mile from an airport and an Air National Gaurd airbase, as well as a father with 40 years aircraft mechanic experience and myself as a aircraft mechanic in the airforce, I have seen most every imaginable aircraft known to man.  This craft, or light, was obviously a UFO.  The sky in the backdrop was near dusk and virtualy cloudless.  The flight path that this was on carried it directly overhead.  As it approached I noticed there was no sound whatsoever.  Being alarmed by this I sent my youngest boy running in the house to retrieve a disposable camera that unfortunatly was in my vehicle at my wifes work.  As my child went to retrieve camera my other son and I continued to keep our eyes trained on said craft.  It continued its path diligently without variance.  I followed it with my eyes as far as I could until it dissapeared.  When it dissapeared I immediately went to the middle of the street looking up and down searching for someone else who seen this.  Unfortunately, there was no one.  I will conclude by saying this:  This was a UFO.  Not only to me, but to anyone who would have saw it on this earth.  Also, having lived in this town for 38 years I have learned the flight paths of aircraft in this area.  In my three years living at this house I have never seen an airplane, helicopter, durigable, or any o! ther cra ft fly in this direction.  Especially at that altitude.  For the last year I have dilligently watched the sky looking for a craft flying this direction.  To no avail.  But I gotta tell ya, the no noise thing to this day gives me goosebumps.

The porch light was on.  A car had passed by in the neighborhood and it sounded as if it had just blown a tire a block or so away before approaching our (my fiance and I) house.  This is unrelated, I'm sure.  I am always aware of my surroundings and we do get many military craft flying in to the local military base.  I noticed a what appearded to be an aircraft flying in toward Tacoma from the West.  This is not a normal flight path but some planes do fly in this direction I suppose headed toward Sea Tac or Boeing Field in Seattle.  At first I noticed the color of the light wasn't 'normal' - more of a reddish/orange light.  And I was wiating for familiar 'wing lights' to be present.  This was a single light and it appeared to be moving in a very straight (due East) direction.  I watched it for a few seconds and maybe after 20 seconds or so I noticed the light dimming (this object appeared to be headed toward my direction) and slightly dip dramatically straight down and disappear.  This is hard to judge distance (of course) but if my field of view was shown in a photograph I suppose the 'dipping' of the object would be measured as 1/4 inches on an 8X10 photo.  So, this didn't dip very far before disappearing.  There were clouds present and this object appeared behind the clouds but was very visible. I have never reported a sighting before.  I wanted to report this and am sure other's saw this.  I am not aware of any other places to make a report to - I suppose I could contact the newspaper, but don't know if it would be treated with any credibility.",

I have seen planes in this area before, but usually they are high and just passing over from St. Louis to Kansas City. This night, this plane looked \"odd\". It had two bright lights on the front and no blinking lights.  I stopped the truck and turned the engine off but I was a little too far away to get a good look.  I figured it was a (regular) plane.  The next night, Friday, at just about the same time, it was the same route, only with a slight variation which put me closer to the path of this \"plane\". Once again I stopped the truck and turned off the engine.  I watched as it flew almost overhead.  I thought, that's odd, it looked triangular, it had three whitish lights on each tip, but I was still thinking it was a plane, and then I saw the red light in the center of the triangle, it appeared larger than the white ones and I also noticed smaller lights which seemed to be closer to the body of the craft, so that the others seemed to protrude. Then it hit me that this might not be a conventional aircraft! It traveled a path, each night, from northwest, making an arc just about the 122 mile marker on highway 70 and then heading southwest. Northwest direction would be the direction that Whiteman AFB is and the home of the Stealth.  It wouldnt surprise me to find out that this was a Stealth aircraft. I did call Whiteman and spoke with the airflight control, who told me they didnt know what the underside of the Stealth looked like at night. So no info there.. Nor were they aware of any flights at those times, but...? I assured them I wasnt a spy, of course if I were I would all ready know all this!

We were playing behind the house on our uncle's two-acre property. I looked up for some reason and a fireball seemed to descend at a slight arc directly into my face. The fireball was changing with reds, oranges, and yellows moveing about and actually looked as if it was on-fire. From my prospective, it changed from the size of a golf ball to totally engulfing my whole line of sight. It only took about 2 seconds for it to descend to me and it was not a direct path, but instead slightly arcing. Startled, I looked at my cousin who also seemed surprised. We briefly discussed the occurrence with great excitement, as children do, and ran back to the house. I can't remember the exact reaction from any of our adult relatives, but I do recall that no notice was paid to our story. To this day, my cousin and I remember and occasionally discuss our experience. The hair on my neck stands up every time.

I said to look at it and at that time it moved real slightly just so as both of us shook it off as just nothing... but then it started to change colors. Red Green White flashing not very fast but fast enough. We both stared at each other in disbelief and sat their watching it for about a half an hour, in that time it was slowly drifting to the right going up and down still flashing and then it got more intense (brightness) and then dissapeared behind some trees\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the witnesses may have observed a \"twinkling\" star, but that is a guess.

We were walking toward our car which was in parking lot N4.  As we neared Balmer Hall I happened to look up to watch aircraft coming from the northeast on their approach toward Seatac. Planes have always fascinated me and was a Private Pilot for a number of years. When I looked up I noticed a stationary, apparantly rectangular, black object in the sky directly over the north east end of the UW campus which seemed to be at an altitude considerably above the approaching aircraft.  I called to my wife, who immediately looked up and observed the same object.  At first we thought it might possibly be a large bird.  We dismissed that idea since it wasn't moving, didn't have the shape of a bird and appeared to be way too large for its apparant distance from us. We also considered that perhaps something had fallen off an approaching aircraft. Once again we ruled that out since the object seemed to be above the approaching aircraft.  After 15 to 20 seconds the object began to move very smoothly at a very high rate of speed in a Northeast direction directly opposite the path of the approaching aircraft.  At approximately 30 seconds from the time we first observed the object we lost it from sight behind some trees. We discussed the sighting all the way home and have concluded it did not fall into any of the usual bird/aircraft sightings in our experience.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone.  The husband is a former military officer, who considers himself to be quite capable of being able to identify aircraft.  He is insistent that the object they witnessed from the University of Washington campus on this graduation day was not any kind of aircraft that he is familiar with.  PD",

They appeared to be up too high to be attached to the ground.  These lights were pretty close together which also ruled out the possiblity of them being planes as well.  They were stationary the entire time that I saw them.  The color was a white-yellow color; very similar to normal car headlights.  I did not notice any particular shape that these lights formed. They were very brigt for about 2 minutes, and one by one they began to fade out without moving during this process.  After a few seconds from the time they began fading, they were completely gone.

As we looked to the SW, I spotted what looked at first like a white balloon being carried upwards very rapidly. The cloud deck was at about 8,oooft and the object went above them to about 10,000ft and then hovered as if caught in an air pocket. Several other people thought it looked like a grocery type white bag, but there was a smaller piece of a white object that we saw traveling along with the larger \"bag\". It looked unattached. After about 15 minutes of being \"motionless\" the objects started to climb higher until they were out of site to the SW. About 25 people around us saw and watched the objects climb. I've been to many airshows over the years and never saw anything like this before - it definetly was not a balloon. I was monitoring the radio freqs of the airport, but nothing was mentioned about the object.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We would welcome additional reports from other witnesses to this incident.  It does seem odd to us that a simple bag, containing either hot air or helium, would continue to rise so far in such a short period of time, rise above the clouds, and then continue to rise out of sight.

They were moving steady like sat. but slower than any I've seen in the past and on this night.I watched them for probably 60 sec. before I desided to go inside and wake my wife up and have her come out and see what she saw. This probably took another 60 sec. to get her shoes and coat and her outside(I was afraid they would be gone).But they were still there I pointed them out and asked my wife what she saw(I had just told her that I wanted to show her something)and she verified what I had seen. She was able to watch them for probably 30-45 sec. before we lost site of them behind the trees.

I got a friend of mine to take a look and he also thought this was very strange. We drove to downtown towards the college, didn't see anything. Took a right turn on a side street and I spotted it flying over buildings (I was not driving) like it was trying to race with us for about 40 seconds. All of a sudden it was gone, so I told my friend to pull over and park. We walked to the next street over which is Telegraph. Their were a few people standing at a bus stop. My friend asked them if they saw the object. They gave us a look like we were crazy. We jogged down the street and back, didn't see anything and decided to give up. On our way back to the car between Telegraph and the street we parked on, I was on one side of the srteet and my friend on the other side. I looked up and hovering over me and the building I was walking by (I could only see half of the object) was the object. It was rectangler, had lights all around it, but only the corner ones were on. It was dark gray in color, there was a maze like decoration that covered all of the bottom of it. Absolutely no noise at all.

After examining the object for a few moments it hadn't changed position at all and made me start to wonder. Out of curiosity I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see what is was expecting to have just been over reacting. What I saw through the binoculars appeared to be some sort off-white/tan colored object that was sphereical/disc in shape. After studying it for a few minutes it seemed to rotate around on its horizontal axis exposing its full shape. It was a round object that appeared to be composed of an outer ring surrounding a central sphere/disc type object. Unfortunatly my binoculars wern't powerfull enough to make out the patterns on the central part of the object clearly, but there was obviously some sort of design/patterns in the central portion. It only alluminated that one color but had a orange light/orb that would come from it, move around a bit, then go back. After looking at this go on for approx 10 minutes I went inside and grabbed my digital camera and took pictures of it. Unfortunatly my camera doesnt have a zoom feature but the light/object is clearly seen in the pictures and if magnified the shape is noticable. After 30 minutes of observing this object to the west I noticed a second object to the south, orange in color and further away. It seemed to bare a resemblence in shape as the one to the west but I couldn't see it as well. I studied the object to the west from dark till sun rise (Approx 2 hours.) even after all the stars in the sky had gone the object was still very visable. Finally the sun came up in the west blinding any attept to continue looking at the object. In one of my photos the object isn't where it was and a second grey disc type object is in veiw, much closer. Although I never saw it while I was outside. After some research and photo enhancment it bares some resemblense to a water spot that the camera had poss! ibly con trasted out. I still dont 100% agree with this possibility due to the fact most of the water spots that become visable through enhancment are oval in shape and barely visable. This object is a perfect circle. I wasn't expecting to see what I did but now I'm changed from being open minded about ufo's to beleiving, as I've seen one with my own eye's. Either alien or military testing, whatever it was, was much more then anything I've even dreamed of.\n\r\n((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nI made an error in my report \"Occurred : 6/4/2001 04:00 (Entered as : 06/04/01 0400) Reported : 6/6/2001 01:30 Posted : 6/21/2001 Location : Fresno, CA\". the object was in fact in the EAST, NORTH EAST, not west.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We believe that at least one of the two luminous objects described in this report may have been the planet Mars, which would be visible in the western, or southwestern, sky at this time of morning.

It was late evening - early morning on the night of March 31-April 1, 1966. (This is a date I will always remember) A friend of mine and I had picked up another friend from work who worked the afternoon shift at an auto plant and were returning to the driver of the vehicles home in Dearborn, Michigan.  I was 19 at the time. My two friends were 17 and 24. We were heading north on Monroe street.  We had just drove past Outer Drive when I had a very strange feeling. About a block past Outer Drive, Monroe makes about a 45% turn to the left. It is just past that point when we all spotted a \"Space Craft\" hovering over a Public swimming pool/playground located at an elementary school off to our left.  I use the word Space Craft, because it was NOT a UFO as we saw it VERY clear.  It was about 200 feet from us at about 50-75 feet in the air. We saw it so clear that we could see the partitions that seperated the crafts lit up windows.  It was boomerang shaped with a row of large bright white windows. It was about 75 feet wide.  The craft had a red glowing light on it underside with smaller lights on it left and right side. It made no sounds.  The only unusual sounds were a static noise on the radio in the car we were in when we were near the craft. As we stopped to watch it, my friend who was driving, blinked the cars head lights at it.  This is when it started to move slowly. The rest of the details of that night are not clear except that I remember we followed it (were led by it) for about 10 minutes and that it seemed to land it a wooded area West of Telegraph road at an area that was then known as Crowley Park. This is when the rest of the nights becomes cloudy in my memory...until sometime after when we went running into a all night Hamburger diner on Telegraph Road.  There were two persons in the diner that also saw the craft as it was flying away from the area. All three of us had (and I still do) a lump in our ear lobe after the encounter.  I have not seen the other two that were with me in several years, so I can not say if they still have the lump or not.  I have been haunted by VERY BAD dreams and odd things happening to me from that night on.  It was just recently that I remembered another encounter some seven or eight years later with a HUGE craft. All the details of that encounter are slim in my mind. I hope to some day be hypnotised to bring all of the memories out...and to have the lump under my ear lobe removed and studied.\n\n\r\n((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))\n\r\nPlease refer to my report I reported to you 6/7/2001 and you posted on 8/5/2001.  Anyway, do you know of any doctor that would remove the lump from my earlobe to see what it is. I would really like to have it removed as I know it is a part of that evening of March 31, 1966.   Please do not post my name as I am a business professional.\n\r\n((END))",

About 20 degrees up in the sky, over the horizon of the west side of Budd Inlet, a very bright white light held steady and very slowly moved up into the sky over a period of 45 minutes and then dissapeared behind the clouds. At first we thought it was a very bright star or a planet, but then it moved, and we realized it was at least 4 times as big and bright as the biggest star or satellite we had ever seen. When we viewed it in the binoculaurs, it appeared that there was a bright white \"electric\" ring buzzing around a greyish object. Interestingly, the object was just above the Fort Lewis base near Tacoma, where we can see bright flashes and feel the ground rumble whenever they test artillery - sometimes as late as 12 midnight. This may have been an experimental military aircraft, given it's location, but whatever it was, it was unlike anything we had seen before and certainly gave us all the chills.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have received no other reports of this incident that we are aware of.

Last night we were both admiring the clouds which were nicely highlighted by the moon. We eventually noticed an amber colored light just to the west of the moon. At first we thought it was a star, but instead of twinkeling it sort of pulsated, also it appeared to be infront of the main haze of the atmosphere but behind the lower clouds as there were absolutely no other stars viewable. It seemed to stay approxamately the same distance from the moon and gave the faint impression of rotation. Neither of us had any binoculars of course so we simply sat and watched it. With the moon highlighting the clouds it was apparent which ones were more dense and which clouds were very thin. This is important because the light would appear through some of the thicker clouds but would disappear behind a mere wisp of cloud. The light also caught our attention because it seemed to be about twice the size of a star, it didn't move as fast a a plane, and it gave the impression of being oblong ( wider to the front, or the western side; than at the back, the eastern side). We saw it again tonight, same place,same time, same location in the sky; but tonight (06/07/01) it doesn't seem to pulsate as much and also it gives a stronger impression of rotation.  I suppose there is probably a natural explanation for this but I simply can't think of one.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a celestial body, either Mars, or a bright star.

My mon got scared and jumped back into the car and told us boys to get in... I was amazed as I continued to watch until my dad told us to get in.  I'm not sure of the exact date but I was there when it was reported all over the papers and dismissed as a weather balloon... yeah right!  I was very young then, but I won't forget the colors within the clouds.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Electrical or magnetic effectsSlowly moving boomerang shape with four bluish-white lights on each leading edge; made a humming sound.\n\r\nIn Octber of 1972 while I was a student I was driving with a friend on a Sunday night returning home from a double date via a country road. We both noticed a bright white light moving slowly from left to right circling a large hill.  We thought that it was a ranger plane and drove on without interest until we noticed that it seemed to be following us.  We could see it sometimes in front and sometimes behind us.  By this time we were driving from 40 to 50 MPH, depending upon the curvature of the road, trying to keep the opject in sight.  Thinking of the height of a broadcast antenna, the object may have been 1000 feet above ground and seemed to be the size of a small fingernail held at arms length.  We also noticed that the FM car radio was being affected by unusual static.  After several minutes of driving during which I either increased or decreased speed trying to view the object better, it finally veered off toward a large empty field and stopped at what looked to be only a few yards off the ground.  I stopped my car and asked my friend to get out with me.  My friend, a large, burly \"country boy\" at first would not leave the car, but later consented to do so.  We observed the object for several minutes until we noticed that it was moving.  We watched in awe as this object slowly soared into the air moving upward at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like a \"chevron\" or \"boomerang\", with the pointed edge at the front.  The two ends were both squared off, not pointed or rounded.  We saw four bluish-white lights on each leading edge.  The object moved slowly, perhaps 20-25 MPH and was possibly 250 feet above the ground and about 500 feet away.  At that height and distance I probably could have obscured most of the object with my open palm held at arms length.  We could clearly see the outline of the main body of the object, which was dark, against the night sky (the moon was almost full), and it was absolutely plain that there was nothing between the two sides of the \"chevron\" - so we could clearly tell that it was not an airplane.  The object made a steady humming sound, not a droning or cyclic sound, like a generator. The sound was not very loud - my friend and I talked as it passed by us - and the sound faded as the object became more distant from us.  The object moved across the road to a distance of several hundred yards where again it looked like only a single light as when we first noticed it, and stopped.  My friend and I got back in the car and moved forward on the road trying to keep the object in sight.  The object began to move and gain altitude and once again a sort of chase resumed, where the object would be either in front of or behind us as we tried to keep pace with it.  The object suddenly stopped at an altitude of perhaps 500 feet, and we stopped directly below it, watching it from inside the car.  The object remained motionless for about 3-4 minutes, and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  Since that occurance I have retired from a career in the military, where I was exposed to all types of airborne craft.  I have never seen or heard any type of jet, plane, or helicopter that even remotely resembles what I observed that night.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I live near a very wooded area, there are NO small airports around the area.   I was sitting on my back porch, along with my friend.  Previously that night I saw a flying object land far out in the woods (about a mile). I didn't think much of it, although I see the same occurance very often.  A few hours later, at 3:47 hours, I heard strange noises coming from the exact area where the flying object landed.  The only thing I can compare the noises to is steal beams being hit together very rapidly, no one lives in those wood so it's not likely it was coming from a house or factory.  About 1 minute into the beam noises, I heard sevral animals or something like that sqealing very loudly, from the same wooded area, I started to feel really nauseated so I went inside and looked from inside, I was also too scared to stay outside, i've never heard anything like this before.  The noised went on for about 10 minutes (thats a rough estimate) until they stopped. About 5 minutes after they stopped the flying object lifted from the woods but when it was in the sky (red lights) It split into two objects (airplane like objects this time but no noises they were silent) each object went in opposite directions, I then stopped looking.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>No other reports from this area.

It was about 8:00pm, fairly clear skies.  My girlfriend noticed something in the sky and pointed it out to me.  It was black, as far as I could tell.. but it was so far away that I guess it could have been some other color.  Anyway, normally I would have thought it was a plane.. but it wasn't moving at all.  It was just sort of floating there.  My next thought was, \"must be a helicopter.\"  But it was much, much higher than I'd ever seen a helicopter.  Then again, I'm not an expect on helicopters, so maybe. We kept looking at it and it seemed to change shape a little.. or it was rotating so that I was seeing it from a different angle.  At one point, I _think_ I saw it split into two pieces.  The two pieces remained right next to each other, though, so it could have just been thin in the middle.  The distance may have made it seem like the parts were separate. After about 15 minutes or so, the object was so faint that we lost it. I realize my description has a lot of \"seemed like\"s and \"couldn't exactly tell because of the distance\"s, but that's the best I can do.  The object wasn't zipping all over the sky or shooting out laser beams or anything.  It was just behaving in a way that didn't match what I expect planes/helicopters to do.

When it was 9:00pm, I turned to the nightly WGN Chicago news program (courtesy of a cable channel; I'm in TN). I had decided to watch it because I wanted to see if they were going to follow up on a report they'd had the night before. Some minutes into the news cast, they began to do the weather. Before I go any further, there's something I need to explain so you can understand what I'm talking about. I have a lot of time on my hands, I guess you could say, and for about the last year or so I've been taping (with a VCR) those shots I suppose most news casts have where during the weather the screen switches to some live view of the city. I've been doing this all this time in hopes of catching something strange on tape. And Wednesday night, after a year or so of waiting, it finally paid off! So, when that sort of shot came on, I was taping it. And within seconds, I was shocked to see what I'd been waiting for all this time: a bright streak of light shot across the upper middle part of the screen and went BEHIND some buildings in the background, going INCREDIBLY fast. MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than ANY jet could go! So fast that I was only able to get a good look at it when moments later I went downstairs and used the other VCR to slow the tape down to a minimum. When it wasn't on slow motion, this is what it looked like: almost identical in appearance to a common shooting star, kind of streak-ish, but it was very different in that ITS DIRECTION MADE A HUGE CURVE!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. It (or another one) would also appear again a few seconds later, this time shooting up from the lower right hand corner of the screen and zooming just as quickly to the upper left! (AGAIN, THIS/THESE WAS NOT A SHOOTING STAR!!!) Upon playing it like I said in slow motion, it was also noticed that a third streak could easily be seen (you couldn't miss it!) coming into the picture just as the camera finally went back to the newscasters. Needless to say, I HAVE THE TAPE and I'll always keep it. I don't remember the exact time, but it was around 9:20pm CST. The streaks were a bright yellowish-white in color. As for my background, I'm 18, and I'll be going to college in August.",

Let me explain further of my sighting. My friend and I were sitting and talking in front of his home on a warm June (Sunday) night. We both were talking on how are day went and mind you we were never under the influence of any kind of narcotic or alcohol for that mater. Both of us are in the status of the upper middle class society (at least I am uper middle class).Well, so we both sat talking when we heard an \"intense whistling and displacemnet of air\". These sounds are not foreign to us, for we both heard them at least 10 other times the last year and a half. After hearing these \"intense whistling and displacements of air\" all was quiet again (except the loud planes from O'Hare airport). Sitting proceeding with our conversations I saw an intense bright object in the shape of a circle floating in the western sky.At first I thought it was a visible star/planet but this was much more intense in lighting. It was flying northbound, but as it \"hovered\" north it gradually faded until nothing of it was visible. A few minutes later we heard the \"intense whistling displacement of air\" seemingly right above of where we sat. My friend has a street light/lamp in front of his home that has always shone (at night) as long as we both could remember, which suddenly turned off and we were imersed in darkness. At this point both of us were quite scared and I had to go. Wanting my friends company on the way home, we heard the same \"intense whistling and dispplacement of air\" above us. When we arrived at my house, which is only down the block, my friend needed me to drive him back home. Granted, he only had to walk about a block to go home but that is to show how sacred my friend was. Indeed, I too was quite affriad so after I dropped my friend off and parked my car I ran inside my home in utter terror.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Given that the witnesses apparently have experienced the same phenomenon on many occasions in the recent past, it makes us wonder whether they are hearing the vortex turbulence generated by the wings of aircraft passing low overhead.  If Harwood Heights is on the approach to a major airport, that might be the explanation.  PD",

I was sorta waiting for the light clouds to go away, really just relaxing then I got a big 8 foot table out my wife had out at a garage sale the day before, got my other two sets of binocs out, and decided to stay a while.  Anyway, this started at 11:30, I had been outside about 1 and a half hours.  A bright light, I will say white-I am red and green color-blind a little, flashed or pulsed or lit-up or whatever to my right, south mostly and a tiny bit west-- I am lying flat down feet pointed directly east.  Pretty damn bright, I think I saw it light up with my eyes closed or maybe partially open, dont really know.  I thought I had missed one of those bright meteorite deally-bobbers.  Approx 5-15 seconds later, now fully alert, a second flash, not really a flash more like a long flash lit up the same area , about like a street light at 2 or three blocks.  I could now see it was moving almost directly north, a tiny bit east.  I pointed my binocs at it and watched it pulse, light up, all the way across the sky, about 30 seconds, maybe 40 seconds, through the binocs until it went as far as I could see to the horizon.  There was no sound,  it looked at first like a aircraft landing light but I really think it was up a lot higher,  like maybe a satellite reflecting sunlight while spinning, but I have probably watched hundreds and hundreds of satellites or space junk or whatever, and they never pulse light like this.  The pulses were not evenly spaced, they were anywhere from 8 to 12 seconds apart, they were pretty bright, and this was a little hard to follow with 10x50 binocs because the light pulses were timed so far apart and not evenly spaced. It disappeared completly between light pulses.  It was about like tracking a satellite across the sky, had to have been visible to a huge area on the ground, About 2 to 6 minutes after this, a satellite went over from west to east, all the other satellites were going north to south or south to north-cant remember now. Never saw anything like this before, pretty wierd, you would agree if you had seen it. I remembered the west-east satellite for reference and checked all my times with the clock in the kitchen. I dont believe aliens were taking pictures but when I went back inside, I made sure all the doors were locked.... I will take my video camera out with me tonite in case it was a re-occuring type thing.",

I observed the object for approximately 8 seconds. My view was blocked for about 1 second by a tree in my yard. The object traveled at a steady rate of speed and appeared not to veer from its southern course. I could not determine its altitude. There was no sound during or after the object passed over my location. The object was the shape of an equilateral triangle, dark in color (slightly darker than the night sky), with what appeared to be dim off-white lights under each corner facing downward. The \"lights\" on each corner reminded me of the new round LED brake lights used on trucks and buses. The lights were steady in brightness and did not flicker or pulse. After the oject had passed, I wondered why an aircraft would have such lights mounted on the underside. Maybe they weren't lights. Perhaps this was the visible effects of propulsion.....I don't know. As a size reference, after the sighting, I cut out a \u00bd-triangle from a piece of paper. Holding the triangle at arm length gave a good size aspect of the object.",

I do know the difference of conventional aircraft and satalites.  I'd say these objects were about a 1/2 mile up in the air.  They were motionless in the sky except for the one which was cruising around the stationary one.  I called out to my roomate and told her  to come see what I was looking at, but she wasn't available.  I kept watching them and they started blinking in and out, that's when they started flashing and blinking to different points in the sky further and further away from eachother.

I was looking out through space because the night was crystal clear even though there was a lot of heat lightning over the sea.I was listening to my car radio and lying on the hood of my car when I noticed one of the stars ( I was attempting a trial of astral projection)had suddenly left its place in the sky and moved to another location.This upset me a little because I am inteligent and believe that it is perfectly possible for something to travel through space to another planet.So I left my post for a little while and drove a couple of blocks to an all night convenient store for a pack of cigarettes.I was much calmer at this point and was beginning to forget the whole thing when I noticed a sensation of being completely alone as I was driving back to the parking lot.It seemed like I could here the crickets humming from miles away and the sound of my own heartbeat was clearly audible.I parked the car got out and started my patrol around the condo.I was just starting to round the corner when I notised a little fog was visible and I could see the parking lot lights.Suddenly I noticed from my left someting approching at a very slow speed through the light fog.I remember thinking I hope this is a flock of pelicans but unfortunately it was not. I saw a ship at an altitude of about 20 ' traveling less than 30 mph moving across the parking lot.I noticed the design had to be alien because of its overall shape being unlike anything of the earth my experience coming from being in the army and my father who worked for Grumman corp.The cockpit was like anondized metal black and opaque like some kind of energy absorbing substance.I believe the color of the ship was subdued green. The wings were delta shaped and! bent do wnword  away from the fuselage.It was almost past when I noticed engines and ports situated in back and tucked under the wings.Just the a tremendouse muffled blast came out of the engines and I could follow its tightly twisted vapor trail till the object was completely out of site way way out into space in about 10 seconds.THere is much more too be told about ie. its physical effects on myself but I have run out of time for now.",

As the jet passed,  I caught sight of another object, oval-shaped, light-colored with a dark circular spot in the center.  I was looking up at a steep angle so could only see the bottom of the object.  The only reason I spotted it was because the sky was overcast with dark clouds that day.  With a normal clear sky I would have never seen this object. It was slowly moving from north to south with a slight oscillating wobble about the vertical central axis.  Althought the object had a definite shape, the edges were oddly indistinct as though viewed through diffuse glass.  When it reached a spot due east of me, it stopped and hovered for a minute before almost leisurely continuing on south until out of sight.",

Today, we had a Tropical Storm passing through so there was periods of sun and periods of rain. Durng a sunny period I was watching planes making Chemtrails all over the sky when I first noticed the shimmer of the sun on a plane overhead and as I watched, I noticed the shiny ball or sphere riding right along side of the plane.  As I watched the sphere it seeed to just disappear within a minute or so.  Also as I noted before, there was a fuzzy area around the sphere which made it hard to focus on.

Anyhow, i was comming home with 3 people (one was my driving instructer) another was a guy learning how to drive with me.  We all saw it..and that's how i know i am not crazy in writing this to you. We saw it decend slowly down from a star..and then take a slant upward to the right...as we were going home from Sulpher Springs toward Commerce, Tx...(we had passed the point of the railroad tracks on the way home before the event occured) ..  As it took the slant upward..it appeard to increase in speed and disappear for a short 1 or 2 seconds and then reappear at a higher altitude.  then it went across the sky following the same length of the road we were on...and i fear that even though it was high up in the air...that we can only see it as a dot of light (redish,whitish, and bluish...i don't know if the colors were rotating or what but it appeared to show those colors ) I felt that it (the craft ) had taken pictures of us ..or at least knows that we viewed it. I believe that it isn't an alien ship..but rather some govt. intelligence work..they are using new types of crafts and testing their use.. The other observers noticed the craft with me ..and were in shock ..just like me..we sat still as the whole event occured.

And i do believe that they made a mistake by accidently showing me the ufo..because now..and for the rest of my life ..i am going to always wonder ..and try to figure out what happened on that night.  \n\r\nPS. In our town we have also felt the effects of these ufo's My mother was going into our house late at night and she said that the cars lights and all the lights of our street went out for a few seconds..  I witnessed the lights go out in our house at that moment.. I gather that if it was just the electricity on the city's line then just the houses would experience this..however because the car also had effects..i believe these crafts have some sort of magnetic properites that interfere with our electrical devices.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I noticed what I believed to be \"flashlights\" in a field directly south of the house I was in.  Activity after dark was not common this time of the year so I went outside to check it out. I quickly realized the lights were not flash lights at all.  The Lights appeared to be multy colored orbs or balls of light that changed color rapidly.  I would say the flashing or color changning was similar to when one is star gazing and the stars seem to flicker in wavelength.  They were brighter and more clear than any light I have seen at that distance. The LITS were SE of my location and moved to the E before the event was over.  The is a local airport approx. 1 mile S of the house.  I tried to rationalize what I was seeing as Chopper's from the airport, but the LITS ducked below and then would reappear randomly and differnt locations.  The wind was not notably strong, but even on windy night I can hear all manner of traffic at the airport.  That night I heard nothing.  The Lights, there had to have at least seven, were continually dropping below the horizon then returning to maybe 10 degrees above the horizon.  The were not connected to each other in any way i.e. moved seprately.  They were moving to quickly verticly and horizontally to be winged aircraft and sometimes would hover in one position.  I observed the craft for 2-3 minutes when I decided to find a witness.  I literally dragged my younger brother out into the back yard to watch.  He saw the same thing I did, but with fewer craft, maybe three.  One craft stayed in a hover the other went below the horizon for a final time.  The one that was hovering by itself flew almost exactly east to west flying directly over our heads.  It was had gained a lot of altitude in a short period and was probably @ or above 10,000 ft.  The lone LITS went from hovering above the eastern horizon to below the houses in about 10-15 seconds.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectA friend and I were talking about satilites and how using your perephial vision makes them easier to spot.  I only had to look for about min. when I noticed a moving light. It seemed to appear out of a heart shaped pattern in the sky which was roughly 90 deg straight up from my position in Greenwood.  Directly after this, I noticed that not only was I seeing and object, I was seening 3 points of light triangular in shape moving at the same speed and never getting any nearer or further from each other. This entire object or group of objects was moving to the south-east at a very steady pace only seeming to get slower as it neared the horizon.  All three lights seemed to be the same in intensity as well as size.  If these were seperate objects, they must have been at least 700 to 800 miles apart if not more.  It was about a 2 finger widths distance the hand measure.  I went inside and told my friend that he needed to come see this and He saw the same thing for about 20 more seconds before a gradual decrease in brightness caused the object/s to not be visable.  It would be important to note here that the decrease in brightness happened about 18-20 deg above the horizon.  I have heard of Geo Syncronized Satelites and geo-stationary as well. I am assuming that Geo Syncronized means several satelites are syncronized to do work like global mapping and such.  To do such work effectively would take at least 3 satelites to triangulate a position to be compared to the ground ;ie (temprate rainforest studies) and so on.  This might be the most logical explaination to my sighting and to a another reported sighting that was in May-Englewood California. Please let me know what you are thinking on this.  I have found the use of a stealh blimp to be an interesting yet unlikely scenerio.  What I saw and what the unamed lady described her report match perectly, and what I say would have been to large and to high if it were a blimp.  Keep in mind my veiw of the rest of the sky was unobstructed .  Thank You for your time.

It seemed to \"hover\" above the Pequop mountain range to the east of us.

My home is in the mountains and I have a very good view of both the city of Santa Fe and the city of Los Alamos. I observed this light for a while and noticed it seemed to have different colored lights flashing or something.  I got out my binoculars, and observed that there were indeed different colored lights.  It was too far away to observe the actual shape.  The object at first appeared to be stationary over the city of Santa Fe.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  However over a course of approximately an hour and a half, it very slowly moved over the city of Los Alamos, then very slowly moved lower in the skies until it appeared to disappear behind a mountain in or behind Los Alamos.  It went down not far from a red flashing light in the mountains, so I thought it might have to do with some sort of test or research going on in Los Alamos.  During this same period of time, I also noticed two other very bright white objects which appeared to be either round or elipse shaped in two different locations in the skies over Santa Fe.  Neither object appeared to be moving.  Both were very far away.  I observed an airplane during this period and compared the plane to these objects through my binoculars.  The three unidentified objects bore NO resemblance to the plane.  Two of the objects were still in the sky when I finally went to sleep at approximately 4 AM.  All of these objects were lower in the skies than the stars.  It was a very clear night.  All of these objects were much brighter than the stars and were easy to distinguish from the stars due to their extremely bright lights and to the fact that they seemed at times to move, although VERY slowly. I have never made a UFO report before or seen a UFO.  I am 52 years old, female, and co-owner and co-founder of a company.  Prior to that, I was a top executive in a major ad agency for 20 years.

We initially thought it was a satellite, then a plane, then couldn't make an exact determination as it was traveling too fast to be either, but still slower than a falling star. It moved exactly like a slow moving satellite in that it didn't deviate course, but stayed in an exact line. Unlike a satellite or plane it disappeared when it was directly overhead instead of it remaining visible to the end of the eastern horizon. It appeared to change brightness just before it disappeared, somewhat of a corona around the object or the light simply became more diffuse. We enjoy sky watching and this objects behavior was a first for the both of us. We have seen numerous planes, metorites, and satellites.",

The plane had NO lights and was coming from the direction of the clouds out in the ocean.  I had just enough time to point and film the airplane with the camera on night shot and focus set to infinity.  I went to play back the footage and see what I had captured.

In the foreground was a jet airliner making its way in the same direction (NE) of the 3 stars which were much higher and moving much slower than the aircraft. Venus remained stationary as a point of reference. I said to the boys: \"Look at those 3 stars moving up there.\" They looked and said they saw them, then they faded away.

I followed this green/ yellowish light as it went streight up slowly. When I first saw it, the light was already above the tree line, so I could'nt tell how close it was. I thought it odd that it was'nt flickering, just getting smaller. Then the light started moving south to north. I never heard a sound as it flew its course. I thought it must be a heliocopter and did'nt take my eyes off of it because I thought it was interesting that I could'nt hear it yet. As it got midway between the park and my house I could tell that it was not assending any longer and I could see some reflection from the city lights on the underside of the craft. It's then when I could'nt belive what I was seeing. I saw a round saucer shape with only one green yellowish light at the rear of the object. As it went north iI was able to follow it north untill it slowly went out of sight. I thought to myself, Did I just see what I thought I saw! I could not tell how high the craft was, how fast it was moving, or hear any sound at all. I do know that the cloud deck that night was around 8000 ft ASL. and winds aloft were less than 5 knots. The craft never went behind the clouds the whole time that I saw it, so I know it was under 8000 ft. I,ve never seen anything like this before....Ever!",

My mother and I were driving home to Lidgerwood, in southeast ND, from Fargo.  We were driving down state highway 46.  I looked out the passenger window into a field and saw a large glowing light, moving silently throught the field, pacing the car.  I asked, \"Mom, what's that?\" At such a young age, I was merely curious, completely unafraid.  I had no idea what a UFO was.  When my mother looked over at the field and saw the object, she was visibly frightened, and punched the accelerator of the car.  I remember looking at the speedometer and noticing we were driving 85 m.ph., which confused me.  Seeing my mother frightened began to make me feel a bit scared, too, and I kept looking at this glowing object as it stayed with us, approximately 100 yards into the field.  As I was so young, and all of this is a bit foggy in my memory, I can only give rough estimates.  I would say that the object was perhaps 50-60 feet long, it was difficult to see how wide it was.  It glowed brightly, and made no sound.  After a bit, i seem to have fallen asleep, I really can't remember how it all ended.  All I know is that we arrived home safely, and whenever I have asked my mother about the incident, she is reluctant to talk about the sighting, usually dismissing it as swamp gas.  As an adult looking back at what I saw, I find it hard to believe that we witnessed swamp gas glwong and pacing our car at 85 m.p.h.  Somebody regress me!!!! I want to know what I saw!!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Unfortunately, my boyfreind nor I had a watch to inquire about time. We noticed a bright yellowish ball of light in the northern part of the sky. It was much larger and brighter than the northern star.  A few seconds later it was alot closer and instead of appearing as a ball of yellow light, we saw a rainbow of colors (blue, green, red, yellow) that seemed to flash around an object that was hovering. From this object we then saw a smaller yellow ball of light descend horizontally toward the ground.  The object quickly came closer and flew above us.

(Story): A school friend and i camped outside(after the last day of high-school exams) in the backyard at his parents place...my friend was listening to a recorded tape of a football game from the previous afternoon.  I didn't care to listen to it so i positioned myself so that half of me was outside the tent(laying down on my back). I folded my hands behind my head and looked upward's into the clear night sky to look at the stars(amazingly... at that time in Edmonton... one could still see the stars at night).  After a short while(30 to 60 minutes)... i saw something very odd and striking directly above me... very high in the sky. It was very Black...very clearly Triangular...with rounded edges, not sharp or pointed edges. Because i could make out evenly spaced lights all around the triangular circumference of the object, i could see that it had rounded edges... and interspersed within its shape was a limited assortement of lights with no pattern or organization. All the lights were white(no-colors)...and perhap's a little less brighter than the star-light( it blended almost perfectly into the black starry sky).  Like the other witness said... if he hadn't been directly looking at that exact position in the sky he probably would have missed it...this was the same for me... i was afraid that if i took my eyes off of it... that i might lose sight of it( the lights of the ship blended with the stars making it hard to see). It indeed was stealthy and hard to keep track of visually. It was without any sound at all!. At that moment my friend's dog which was inside the tent with him went absolutelely berserk...barking like mad...(the dog was quiet all evening)...I quickley got up off the ground to stand up to track it as it moved at a startling speed(no jet travels that fast...ever!) from the ! north-we st to the south-east in a straight line towards the horizion where the very 1st indications of the next morning's sunrise glow was just barely dicernable. As i got up i had only enough time to call out my friend's name 3-4 times to get him to come out of the tent to see the object with me before it was gone altogether!. He didn't even have a chance to come out... this whole scenario was over with in less than 10 second's... his dog returned to his normal quiet self!. Correctly or Incorrectly i evaluated this object as being very large... i thought that it must be approximately a half a mile to a mile long... it did not look like it was small at all!. At this moment i would not care to be contacted by phone... however E-mail would be alright with me.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Tonight, I had gone over to a friends' house with some other people intending to spend the night just laying around with sleeping bags in her backyard talking and just having a good time. It is an extremely clear night tonight. Very beautiful with all the stars showing. We checked out a couple falling stars until one thing seriously caught our attention. We just saw this dim light flare up suddenly in the sky. We all thought it was a meteorite that seemed to be heading for us and it gave us a quick scare. It dimmed again and we saw it fly slowly away and then suddenly jet off at an intense speed and then stop practically on a dime. It freaked me out the most because last year, on Victoria Day I believe, I had taken my girlfriend on a canoe ride late at night. It was an equally clear night and we sat in the canoe gazing at the stars. We had been drifting for some time when we'd seen a craft in the air jet from one side of the sky to the other at a blinding speed and then stop immediately. We were spooked but ignored it for awhile.Then we realized it was doing it again and once stopped and sort of shimmered back and forth. It was weird. We started to panic a bit but tried not to look at it. Then when we thought it had left my girlfriend told me to look in between two bright stars in the sky. No more than a mile away there seemed to be a cylindar shaped object just stopped dead in the sky. It seemed to be watching us. We heard no noise. We just saw a grayish object dimly lit near the bottom sort of spinning in the sky. It looked like just what you'd see on those UFO specials on TLC. We had not been drinking that night and I am a devout Christian who will swear by these words. It gives me the creeps to think about but it doesn't terrify me. I think it's probably just some top secret government experiment. Who knows. Oh, and if you'd like to know my mental capacity. I'm a second year college student. Thank you.",

We could hear no sound at all from the object,I saw white lights underneath but I can't remember in what shape and pattern.It was a clear night,and the object was dark colored ,I would say black.When the object went over us, it went over the field on the left,never getting any higher up,and not changing speed.

I want to come forward with a complete report of my sightings which occurred on 3/1/01 at 04:50. I am a construction contractor, 43 years old and have lived at ((town deleted)), Oregon all of my life. I spend much time out doors, camping out hiking and star gazing. My home elevation is 1100 feet and I see passenger jets fly over all the time. (and military) I see them fly over in various cloud formations and at night I have studyied them with their fog lights on, rays pointing downwards at the forward angle. The luminance is yellow in the cloud ceiling and one inch long at arms length. During the day, passenger jets average 1/4\" to 1/8\" inch at arms length. The speed of the passenger jets is quite slow. The object I saw that early morning was 2\" inches at arms lenght and was moving fast in the ceiling at about eleven thousand feet. I saw the clouds passing under it and the brightness was like a white sixty watt flourescence with a hue of blue. And a faint red was glowing at the center through the mist. I heard no sound, it was traveling North with one light in the forward position. The three lights were about 3/8\" inch in diameter at arms length. After seeing this thing I immediately went out side with a flash light and saw to my West other lights at an angle of about 30 degrees. They were an odd arrangement of lights, 2\" inches at arms length. Small bright green lights one red, and I saw a white light not flash but pulse only once at the trailing end as it moved behind the tree tops. As it moved North, I heard a faint low rumble. I continued studying the sky and could see the brightest stars shining through the ceiling and there were small breaks in the clouds. I saw a triangle of lights directly over my head, 1 1/4\" inch at arms length, brighter than the other stars and I was suspicious of this and watched them for about 15 seconds when suddenly a bright flash occurred at the center of the triangle. all three lights just blinked out. I studyied the sky for about a half hour after that, but saw no oth! er movin g objects. At day break I noticed the clouds to be at about eleven thousand to thirteen thousand feet above the surrounding mountains. In my back yard, Mt Horeb is directly North of my house at two and a half miles and is 4212' feet high. The object I saw that early morning, flew directly over its position.",

Was reported before but did not get posted.  Was on another short vacation in Colorado in Buena Vista Colorado and stayed at the Rainbow Lake Resort located almost at the top of Cottonwood Pass.  While on a wind down walk with my mother-in-law, we both stopped to view the many stars in the sky that we otherwise could not see where we live in Texas.  While gazing at the stars we both noticed, at the same time, some movement within the milky way star groups.  What appeared to be a star that was stationary began to move and drop out of formation.  We figured it was a star burning out and shooting across space.  With further viewing with the binoculars we both noticed that it slowed down from going north and then started changing colors to blues, purples greens, orange in many revolutions of colors then it fired back into the star group within the milky way.  Strange to see this, we both thought, then the object zapped out of the group again and then with incredible speed zig zagged across the sky like no jet or object of flight the man can build. The directions were qucik and precise and at angles that no airplane we could design. I am ex-Air Force Special OPS and have never seen this display of exact super speed movement.  My mother in law proceeded to ask me what that was, and I advised that we may have just experienced a UFO.  The object continued to change direction back and forth at different angles and of course changing colors in its movement.  The colors seemed to increase in speed with the super fast speed of its directional changes.  Then the object became almost stationary but still showing very slight movement....moving northward.  Then the colors became intense and the objects colors started a revolving movement and it increased in speed faster than any jet I have known of...and proceeded north in the direction of Canada across the sky at very high speeds until it just disappeared. My mother-in-law to this date does not want to talk about what we saw that night.  She i! s a very Christian women and this defied her beliefs.  My understanding of this UFO is that it is not of our world, and if it is our government toy, we stole or enhanced the technology from another world to make this happen.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness indicates that date may be approximate.

The craft was traveling east at an astounding speed.

Even though it was fairly late (around 1AM) there are always a good number of cars on the road at that time.  I was driving when my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, pointed to a beam of light that was pointing straight down at the highway in front of us. At first I thought it was a helicopter shining a spotlight down, but later I would realize that I was wrong.  The light, which was coming from what seemed to be 100-200ft from above the highway, started drifting off to the right.  In 1-2 minutes, the highway turned and we realized that the light was flying directly over the highway.  Just then, the beam turned off and from where it was shining from, a blue light appeared and sped away at an incredible speed over the horizon. About two seconds after the light sped off, another large bright blue light shot down from what seemed to be outer space to the area that the origional light went to. As we continued along the highway, about five miles down the road we noticed that off to our right, several miles away (in the general viscinity of where the lights earlier flew to), several blue and red balls of light were flying around each other at odd velocities and manuvering like no aircraft we had ever seen.  At this point we figured we would get the best view if we got out of the car to look.  The four of us stood and observed the manuvering craft for a few minutes before all but one blue one flew away over the horizon.  The remaining craft, we realized, was flying towards us!  All four of us began to get nervous about this strange event but we couldn't turn away.  Slowly, the craft flew directly over us, silently, at an unknown altitude.  This gave us the opportunity to see, by the orientation of 9 blue lights on it's leading edge that were flickering like strobe lights, that it was v shaped.  It continued on at this speed until we couldn't see it anymore. We were glad a beam didn't shine on us when it passed directly over us!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness indicates that date may be approximate.  PD",

The ones that look like F5's) flew nearly overhead  of my location in East Mesa. Unusual but I've never seen trainers here before. They flew in a tight formation, north to south, at an estimated altitude of 5000 ft, disappearing from view in approx. 2 minutes. Although the speed must have been nearly supersonic, at the capacity of military power(without afterburner) the engine noise was really quiet...less than a Lear jet cruising. Falcon Field airport is a few miles away, I've seen plenty company jets. Williams Gateway airport is a few miles south, and Chandler Municipal Airport a bit south of that...I believe all have radar. As the aircraft diminished to a dot on the southern horizon I noticed what at first I thought was a vulture riding the thermal air currents just to my south, between the jets and my location. We see that all the time out here. My assumption was short lived. What I witnessed behind the trio of trainers I thought to be a large bird in the distance playing in the thermals--a thick, short horizontal line moving back and forth, then in lazy circles, above the clouds then below, behind a tree then behind a house then vertical. The object moved like a balloon on the wind but had the flat appearance of the thicker edge of a matchbook held at about 15 feet. The object vanished into a cloud bank about 90 seconds after the jets faded from view, south of my location, slightly east of the trainer formation. From the time I lit a cigarette and the jets flew over to the end of the sighting was less than the time it took for me to finish my cigarette. There was no metalic reflection, just flat black. The distance was too great to discern shape, but it wasn't a bird, nor conventional aircraft. But it could have been military.",

We watched it for about 5-7 min then it started to move at average speed of plane in flight. I made a joke and said that the only way we would know it is a UFO was if we were to see a couple of jets go after it and like 2 min after making that statement we heard a loud noise and looked up and saw 4 jets going after the craft.

I put on my sunglasses and billed cap and scanned the sky just East of the suns corona where the main part of the sun was above the bill on the cap. The area of the sky observed from this position was approximately the Zenith. This beach area is approximately 1 mile North of LAX. My head was toward the water so the runways and departing flights were to my right. After noticing several high altitude jets that had made their cruising altitudes after take off and were now proceeding East, an object suddenly appeared near the Zenith about 10 degrees East of the sun's corona. Focusing on the object which was moving at a moderate clip at about 40K feet in a  N-NW  direction, I noticed it was a configuration of three bright spots, maybe lights, two in front and one in back. There seemed to be a blurry darker area surrounding this config. The sky was powder blue with only a minimum of high altitude vapor making very faint almost transparent clouds. I continued to follow it in its path and noticed that it was now looking like a sharply defined very bright, white in appearnce, angular bomerang shape with an equally bright spot in the rear. After this point it disappeared into the distance. The altitude estimate here is based on the size of a standard 747. still on a straight route.",

Its light source appeared to close in around itself to a dot, then no luminousity could be seen. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds, with myself, my father and my girlfriend as witnesses.

I glanced up to see a large bright white light moving very fast.  The brightness was much greater than an Iridium flare or the ISS at a very high intrinsic brightness.  The speed of this object was so much greater than any conventional aircraft or orbiting satellite.  I said, \"look up! look up!\", and everyone did to see the object continue in a straight line completely over the horizon. The object travelled from NW to ESE, and was visible for about 10 seconds.  When the object was directly overhead near 90 degree azimuth, it changed into a phosphorus-like green color, and amber \"sparks\" appeared to emit from the object, along with a slight, short-lived vapor trail.  The object maintained its incredible speed and straight direction.  The object never broke apart, no sounds were heard, so subsequent sonic boom.  The object should have been visible over east-central Alabama and west-central Georgia as it continued its course. The eight adults who were present discussed the object for a while.  We decided that if the object were a meteor, then it would have disintegrated to some degree while visible to us.  Other logical explanations include the re-entry of a decaying satellite, booster rocket or some large mass of space junk coming back into our atmosphere.

Her 5 year old son was watching TV at the time with her. She walked out her front door and down a small flight of stairs and proceeded to walk about 30 feet out into her driveway. She looked to the East and there across Boswell Road floating above her neighbors field were three, or four, egg shaped burnt orange lights hovering above the ground. They were perfectly silent and motionless. They stood perfectly still. She watched for some time then ran inside to get a camera but found the batteries dead. She called the neighbor in whose field they were hovering and told her to hurry and look outside. The neighbor ran outside but forgot to take her glasses. My daughter ran back outside and spotted a flashlight at the objects. This action caused one of the lights to suddenly shine a strong powerful light directly down toward the ground. The light came over at my daughter who immediately ran inside. On going inside she also noticed one of the craft silently dart off toward her house and steak away. Whatever happened she doesn't know but the TV suddenly popped and shut off and a humidefier like divice also quit operating. My daughter called the local radio station AND REPORTED what she saw.

June 25th 2001 my wife and I walked outside to see a friend off, and looked toward the east and at what I would estimate to be about 25,000 ft., there was an intense white light similar to an aircraft landing light, but more brilliant and appeared to me surrounded by a mist.  This object lit up the entire cloud of mist, and appeared to also be shining downward, lighting the entire area below it. We watched as the object appeared to be moving to the west, when it suddenly shot vertically at about 45 degrees to an almost indeterminate altitude and moved at great speed to the southeast and disappeared from sight. The cloud which extended vertically and appeared to be several thousand feet high continued to glow white for several minutes after the object departed and drifted directly overhead, having moved from east to west. From our home here we often watch the Space Shuttle launch, and this object was way too far south to have come from the Kennedy Space Center, and we saw no indication that this object came from ground level. I am a former Police officer and pilot, and can judge altitude and speed pretty well, but this object, accelerated from almost zero to what had to be 3 or 4 thousand MPH in a burstand was gone. My wife and I are ardent sky watchers and frequently spot sattelites and the ISS, and can tell you that this was neither, and the intensity of the very WHITE light is inconsistent with the orange-yellow glow of a rocket, and I am familiar with just about every OTHER kind of conventional aircraft there is.....I have been involved with Warbirds, and almost every thing that flies,  and this doesn't fit ANY type of aircraft I know of.

My boyfriend and friend became excited after seeing a satellite sized object move across the sky and then stop and become intensely brighter, then appearing to \"pan\" with this same bright light across the area.  At this time the circular object was to north of us.  After panning across the sky it dimmed as if someone had switched off a light and then became very small again and headed to the west.  After 20 to 30 minutes, my friend began to flash his flashlight upward to the sky overhead, wher I noticed to the south the same object, but much lower, repeating the signal back.  I told the other two and they confirmed this.  The light was larger and fairly closer this time.  Afterwards, it returned to the sattelite size and shot again to the west.  After becoming upset, we loaded up the truck and went back to Lewistown.  My friend riding in the back of the truck noticed the object again as we were leaving. He said it repeated a similar action to those of before. Each time the light was very bright, and much brighter than any star or planet in the sky.  It even outshone Jupiter which was clearly visible in the sky.  There were no clouds that evening to block our view.  After the first sighting, we noticed that within five to ten minuts afterwards, two planes intersected over the spot, one from the east and one from the west, almost as if investigating the incident.  This is meerely speculation though.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We observe that the \"flare\" that the witness describes might have been the phenomenon caused by Iridium satellites.

I wouldn't have even given this aircraft a second look had it not been for what I saw ABOVE it. I witnessed a definite orb/sphere shape above this aircraft.  The orb/sphere looked to be somewhere on the lines of about 500 or less feet above the conventional aircraft and was flying in PERFECT unison with the \"normal\" craft.  As both crafts moved overhead I was able to see the glint of the sun off of them at one point, and this is how I could best relate to the shape of the orb/sphere.  I am not a pilot or in-the-know about flight altitudes; however, I estimate that the conventional craft was at about an altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet and, as mentioned, the orb/sphere was about 500 or so feet above the conventional aircraft.  I have never seen two planes fly so closely above one another and in perfect unison unless, of course, I was watching an air show.  Also, as mentioned I could distinctly see that the uppermost craft was of an orb/sphere shape. This event occurred at 10:38 a.m. (Pacific) time.  Once that I observed the spherical nature of the uppermost craft, I immediately ran back inside to get my camera.  I did take a photo of the crafts as they travelled away from me, but by the time that I got back outside with my camera (about 20-25 seconds later), they were both a considerable distance away.  If the photo turns-out I will most assuredly send it to you. The day was clear with sparse clouds.  This was a daylight sighting.

We would go outside and sit on my Grandparents porch practically every night to just talk and so on.  \n\r\nThis particular night my Grandmother and I were sitting out on their front porch as usual talking.  Let me tell you that the night was totally dark--not a star in the sky.  I dedided to go out in the front yard to look at the sky (I have always been facinated with the sky and stars etc.).  When I got out in the yard, I looked up and saw a huge disk hovering directly over my Grandparents house.  The perfect outline of a disk could be seen, and the disk had lots of lights all over it.  This object made no noise what so ever.  \n\r\nI yelled out for my Grandmother to come and see this \"thing\" for herself-which she did.  We were both astonished and amazed at what we were witnessing.  She then called out for my Grandfather (who was inside the house) to come out in a hurry to see this object for himself.  He too came outside and witnessed this disk.  It just kept hovering over their house for five to ten minutes.  \n\r\nThen, in the blink of an eye, it was gone.  It had to have taken off at a very great speed.  \n\r\nAs I recall, their were several reports from all over Allen County that night of people witnessing the same type of crafts.  Several were seen by a friend of mine-and he said one landed in their field.  It was possibly on our local news the next day also.  We were told that what we witnessed was a meteorite.  As I recall, meteorites do not hover over a house (or anywhere) for five to ten minutes, and then fly away.  \n\r\nI am a Christian and have an open mind about many things, but this incident-I cannot explain it.  This story is true-we DID see this object.  We saw no \"little green men etc.,\" but we did see something somehow beyond human comprehension.\n\n\n\n\r\n((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate; source is anonymous.

I caught a glimps of something moving from the corner of my eye.When I turned to look at it, I saw a triangular shape moving slowly at about a 45 degree angle. It seemed to be rather close, as I could make out the dark edges against the starry background. If I recall correctly, the object had three lights , one on each point of the triangle. The object made no sound. I immediatly called to my friend to ask if he was seeing what I was. He had not seen it, but just then we both saw something. This one was different. It looked only like a point of light, no noticeable shape. We saw several objects of this kind. They were more over head of us, and moved to the west\\southwest. Some moved at incredible speeds, zigging and zagging across the sky. While others moved in what appeared to be a formation. First came four in a row, then six then eight. Some even looked as though they split in two. After about 20 min. of this we both spotted a triangle- shaped object, this one right over us, we could see lights on the bottom side. The lights seemed to change  color, from red to orange and white. It was very peculiar. We watched this go on for hours, or necks grew tired from cocking them back to see, so we layed down. I remember the clock was at 4:20 when I went in to bed. This was the third sighting I've experienced. In April of the same year,I watched a trianlgle-shaped craft silently fly across the sky in front of me. It had three lights. I was with a different friend, on the same deck. And once before a couple of years earlier, I would have been 18, so that was 1994. It was in spring, this one was like the triangular ones, but much higher. It moved horizontaly for a moment, before shooting upwards at a fantastic speed until I could no longer see it. Again I heard nothing. Neither I, nor my friend know just what we've seen. Could have been military. Who knows what they were, but they were not like anything I! have ev er seen before or since.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

At first I thought it was only a cattle yard or something to that nature, until I looked a little more closely.  I seemed paralyzed when I saw what I saw.  I don't, or didn't, believe in ufo's or aliens, but what I saw was unexplainable, and unbelievable.  I seen a round object, about a quarter or a half mile from the highway.  I know it was round because of the bright lights that went around it.  They weren't colored lights, just white lights.  It was hovering above the ground, motionless.  Not horizontally, but at a slight angle.  Stunned, curious, but honestly and regretably a little frightened, I slowed my speed a great deal as I drove by.  I stared at the object as I drove right by it.  I wanted to stop, to go toward the object, but something inside me said to keep driving.  I have no doubt what I saw, even though I know I can never tell anyone close to me about this, because it sounds ridiculous, like there should be some kind of explanation.

Everyone on the playground seen it. there were a multitude of twinkling lights way up in the sky. all silver. very small but yet visibly shining. there was also an airplane coming in from the southwest, it went behind a cloud and there was a loud explosion. I never saw the plane come back out of the cloud. nor did i see anything fall out of the sky. My principal got back to me and told me the airforce had checked out the lights. I was told it was just tinfoil in the sky. I never saw any report on this incident.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is unknown to the witness.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1974, so the case sorts to that date.  PD",

My son and I were on our way home from work about 9:35pm, we both work in the \"rent to own\" industry. We were traveling south on Nova rd.,in Daytona Beach, Florida when all of a sudden my son, who was looking out the driver side window towards the east,said \"what the hell is THAT'? I began to look out the windshield in the direction that he was and what I saw is VERY DIFFICULT to describe. I saw what appeared to be a single \"cloud\", almost due east from our position. At what is best described as the top of the cloud was a single bright white light. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of some sort with it's landing light on, only the light was NOT moving, IT was stationary and there were NO other lights. As I watched, the cloud began to loose it's density, almost like it was fading away and it seemed to diviide down the middle, the light however, remained at the top of this divison and continued to stay stationary. I took my eyes off of it to check out the road ahead of us as my son was focused on on the phenomena and was not entirely focused on the road. I did NOT see this next part, as it happened when I took my eyes off IT to examine the traffic ahead of us. He (my son) claims that a part of IT OR a second light seperated from it and fell towards the earth. The location of the light was due east of Daytona and would have been over the ocean. MY second thought was that it was a rocket that had been fired from the \"Cape\", but the light was WHITE and NO orange to be seen, besides it was too far north by position to have come from the Cape (due east, NOT south east). It was about this time that the \"cloud\" disappeared completely along with the light itself. The moon at this time was located to the west of us an played NO part of what we saw. As i reflected back, IT reminded me of how the moon sometimes \"peeks\" through clouds with just partial light being seen, but the moon as stated was no where near the phenomena. In MY 47 years, I have NEVER seen anything such as this. I only hope I get the opportunity AGAIN sometime.\n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL; the USAF 45th RANDS unit; and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (\"NOTU\") for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD",

I always admired the city lights on the east side of the river at night. one evening I noticed colorful lights in the sky it was not very cloudy as i looked I could not believe my eyes. The ship was as large as 1 or 2 city blocks or maybe 2-3 football fields in length. Lights were everywhere on this ship. I could make out a definite rectangular shape looking at the lights. It was moving from the north to the south. not very fast but not very slow either. The lights were not reflections, i saw red green yellow blue. It might have been about fifty feet in height and width. I came closer to my house and then it was gone. I told a few people but no one believed me. I would guess it to be about 1500 ft. in altitude. there is no way I was seeing reflections. There was no sound from the craft. I too wonder if there is a secret military base here in town as a previous U.F.O. report states.

One evening my sister and I were at a neighbor's house selling magazines for her high school class fundraiser and while we were there the lights and electricity went out.  Since, we were unable to conduct her magazine business we left and began driving home and I noticed 3 red spheres in the sky.  We watched the red speres flying a incredible speeds, going straight up then stopping, fying across the sky - touching and then  shooting up and down, stopping etc.  We were very excited.  When we gtot home we didn't have electricity either.  We told our mother about the flying spheres and all went outside to watch the red spheres in the sky and at that time noticed back in our woods, we had 175 acres, a very large round, yellow/orange glowing sphere ssitting in our woods.  My mother wanted to go check it out but decided not to because I'm sure she was afraid.  I assume it stayed there all night because later we went inside and I did my homework by candle light.  When we read the local newswapre it stated that on the night of the power outage and our sightings of these objects the power station for the county had been vandalized.

I said what is that? My husband said maybe its a UFO. The light at the top was very bright and seemed to shine down and fan out but only a short distance under the bright light. Then, as we watched, the object made a cloud around itself. At first the cloud was light and then became darker and darker until everything vanished. I put 9:30pm but I am not sure about the exact time. We swim a lot after dark and our development is close to an airport. We see planes going and coming. This was not anything we are familiar with. What really got our attention was that this object never moved. The light came on but did not shine all the way to the ground like a helicopter. It looked like an upside down cone with a bight light at the top. Then it made a cloud around itself, got darker and darker and disappeared. My husband and I went home!\n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL; the USAF 45th RANDS unit; and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (\"NOTU\") for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD",

Its color was the same made by copper when exposed to a flame.  It was just north of northeast and was about the size of my little finger nail when held at arm's length. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and travelled downward in a straight line at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled rapikly and disappeared below the visible horizon.

I then put my binocular's down to help my husband with the grill and then picked up them up again , when I went to look at it had change shape and looked like a column wobbling in the same spot . I turned to say something to my husband and looked back and it was gone from that spot where I was looking .  I then ran down the stairs to see if I could see it more from the direction to west and high in the sky , it was there for just a moment and it was gone ..  As I was looking at this object for the first time I said to my husband this has no wings so it can't be a airplane and it wasn't a helicopter. I know what they look like and this wasn't it ... All of this happen at about 3:20 or 3:30 pm this 1st day of July , Sunday .  There was no sound coming from this object , but it did look to me as if there was some sort of short beam coming from it in a downwards direction ..\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke via telephone at length with this witness, and found her to be a serious-minded person.  Her description of how suddenly the object disappeared from her sight, combined with a similar report from Gresham, OR, approximately on hour later, suggests to us that she may have witnessed something unusual.

A friend and I both saw something as we were walking across the street heading towards a gas station.  We did not receive any signals from outer space or anything like that but we both know what we saw was NOT a firecracker, airplane, shooting star, or comet.  We have both seen things of that nature before.  (Note: we are not and have not been under the influence of any drugs.)  We saw an extremely bright greenish blue light that appeared directly in front of us in the middle of the sky and shot rapidly down across the sky until it disappeared as quickly as it had originally appeared.  There was a bright red trail behind the object and it made no noise (or if it did we were too far away to hear it.)  We realize that todays date is close to the 4th but we KNOW that what we saw was NOT a firework of any kind.  If you receive any other emails regarding this phenomenon, feel free to email us back.  Even if you don't, please email us back with any web pages or other sites that you think we should contact.  We believe that we know beyond a resonable doubt that we DON'T know what we saw.  We also believe that it was NOT any of the things that commonly could have been mistaken for it.  We have seen all the FOX specials and neither one of us believes in UFO's but we can not adequately explain what we saw by using any other word.   We are not crazy, we are just convinced we have seen something that warrants some sort of an explanation.  Please take this email seriously.  We are going to copy this email and send it to a few other sites that we think might be interested to hear what we have to say.  Thank you.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have spoken to this witness, and we find him to be a quite credible and serious-minded.

I am not one to believe in this sort of thing, but the night of June 19 changed my life forever. I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said 'Early? It's 12:30!'.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours. They are just gone..... I am not nuts, or on medications, but I feel like I am getting worse everyday... Please help!

It was moving fast and began to come closer to the ground and to our car.  When we stopped at the stop light it stopped also.  When we turned right it turned right and followed us at the same speed.  We would slow down and so did it and so on.  As we approached the nexted stop light it stopped again.  We turned left and then it turned left.  It followed us either in front of us or to the left of us.  As we reached our destination and pulled into the parking lot it continued to follow us.

We had been standing there talking in her driveway for about 2 minutes when something caught my eye.  I turned and looked at a LARGE reddish light, directly south of us, about 40-50 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be at least the size of my thumb nail when my arm was outstretched. I've been observing Mars for quite a while now, and I read that it was supposed to be at it's nearest distance from earth last week. I said \"Wow!  Look at Mars.  It is HUGE tonight!\" As I said that, I made about a 45 degree turn to my left and looked at my friend,and there, way up in the S.E. sky at about 70-80- degrees, was the REAL Mars, looking sort of pink, and maybe less than half the size of my little thumb nail.  It was a clear night and the moon was out in the S. Western part of sky.  (The light was smaller than the moon.) I personally witnessed the yellow light formations that have been seen repeatedly over Rockford in the last 2 years, plus I've got 2 videos of the same phenomena, taken by a friend who saw the lights at other times. (Peter,I sent you his 1st video, and if he ever copyrights the second one, as you suggested, we'll send it to you.)This new light was alone, at least we only saw one. The color was reddish brown, with maybe a yellow haze around it.  We both thought it looked more oval than round,and to me the light shone out from top, bottom and sides the way the \"Star of Bethlehem\" is depicted, but that could be my eyes.  I thought the yellow lights looked that way, too, but in the videos they are round.) We watched the light for about 10 more minutes, and I believe I saw it blink several times, and then it started to move slighty to the west. Within a minute or two, it went behind a large stand of trees. My friend lives 1.3 miles N. of East State street. (The lights are often seen by witnesses near State St.) Judging by the size of the light, it seemed relatively close, and we could still see the light glowing through the trees, so I got in my car and went to look for it, but by the time I got out to the main road it was gone.  I did see 2 airplanes flying in the direction of the light--one while we were still looking at the light, and the other when I reached the main road. The airport is in the same direction, though, so the planes may have been a coincidence.  I drove back to her house about the same time 2 nights later and stood in the same spot and looked for a long time to see if we could have seen a street light from E. State Street, or somewhere in between.  There was nothing. I saw a stand of trees about 4 blocks south. I think they were the same ones. My friend and I are both teachers with masters degrees, aged 45 and 53.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We wonder whether the witnesses might be observing Mars, currently visible in the southeast sky.

My first impression was that I was seeing a white pilot chute and that the main chute wasn't opening. The speed and direction wern't right for a parachute and skydiver and the object faded and disappeared from sight. At first I thought it might have been a satelite (it still could), but why could it be seen in brite daylight? I suppose from my angle of viewing, it could have been bottom lit by the sun.

This second plane was a smaller business jet, probably a Cessna Citation as the wings were straight out from the body of the plane. It was flying at around twenty-five to thirty throusand feet in altitude. As I watched the small jet for a moment, two non-twinkling objects about the brightness of medium stars and about the same apparent size passed to either side of the small jet in the exact opposite direction. As the two objects continued in a due west direction and just before passing directly overhead, one object (the one that passed on the plane's right, or south side) abruptly turned to the southwest at a forty-five degree angle. The other object continued on a little farther and then turned due north. The turn was immediate, not like an airplane making a banking turn. I continued watching this one and in a few seconds it was joined by two more, one coming in from either side and together they formed a triangle, continueing to fly due north. After a couple more seconds, they moved in what I can only describe as a dance as they moved playfully around each other. Almost immediately they were joined by two more, one coming in from each side again. The five ojbects continued north until I could no longer distinguish them from the bright, blue sky. I have since seen (not without some excitement on my part) a report on T.V., with video no less, of almost exactly what I saw. The objects were described as 'pearls'. They were the same as I witnessed; silent, white and round and did not seem to give off light of their own. The objects on T.V. were also in diamond formations of many more than I saw (up to thirty at a time). Single 'pearls' would even turn away from the others at smooth forty-five degree angles.",

I had the luck of photograhing the F-117 as it flew by the Syracuse airport. The object I am writing about was seen &amp; photographed in North Syracuse, on 9.14.1997, the day of the air show here, &amp; very close to the airport, within 2 miles of the airport. I was about 50' North of a car dealership sign, the object in the sky was southwest of my position, in the sky. I was off of South Bay Rd. in the above mentioned town when the unknown object was seen. My car was parked near the dealership, &amp; the sign when the unknown was seen &amp; later photographed. The object was somewhat boomerang shaped, the middle was more flattened out however, one source has labeled it a flying rod. A hair on a camera lens comes to mind, as does a tree twig, but the object was seen before it was photographed. The object appeared dark in color, the sun was out but there were numerous big white clouds in the sky. The day might be considered a day of filtered sunshine. (?) Beside myself as a witness, I was able to photograph 4 military aircraft flying by. The military planes were flying in a westward direction, as the object was moving past me in the sky in an eastward directn. The object maintained its shape from the time I saw it until I actually photographed it. After I photographed the object, I lost track of it. Note also that I have sent the photographs to Langley, AFB &amp; had received a thank-you letter from the commander at that time, now retired, but no explanation from the military as to what I had photographed. I don't think the object was any cause of the F-117 later crashing, believing the occurence to be something of a coincidence. This unknown was very obvious, but possibly very short lived in terms of duration: I believe nothing has been mentioned in the media about it. However it is almost 4 years later, &amp; I still do not know what the object is. I have a possible suspicion about a 2nd unknown object in the 4 military plane/car dealarship photo. The military, NY MUFON, &amp; NASA have been sent the above mentioned photos. The object I am writing about made no sound. Your organization may email me. Until I know what I have photographed, I would prefer not to give my name out.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness has consented to share the photo with NUFORC.

The object was first thought to be a large firework, but the object did not explode, nor did it stop rising after several  seconds. I then thought that it might be an airplane taking off, as the airport is in that general direction.  The object then appeared to stop rising and track horizontally and southward after it had risen approximately three finger widths at arms length.  At that point, the odd nature of the object instilled curiosity and a desire for further investigation.  I went outside, and through my binocularts tracked the object as it approached me at somewhat an obliwue angle.  My binocular power setting was high at first, and revealed what appeared to be two orange lights seperated by a small distance.  My hands were shakey, and at that power things were hard to focus, so my thought was that it was an airplane with wing-tipped landing/takeoff lights.  However, it struck me that the object was making no sound and the typical red and green marker lights were not seen. I then reduced the power on the binoculars, making it much easier to focus the object, and the thing I saw revealed itself.  The object had a large central orange ball of light, in which a smaller orange ball of light circled at approximately one orbit per second.  Several seconds later orange debree was seen falling from the object, and slowly fading in color, as though it were cooling, and disapperaed prior to reaching the level of the trees and houses across the way.  It was then that I thought the object might be burning material caught on an updraft and prevailing winds, but there were not winds sufficient enough to move the object across the sky as fast as it was travelling, nor did the object's shape and characteristic change after the falling debree.  I continued to track the object for several more seconds until it just vanished.  Through the entire incident no sound was heard, and no other color was seen other than the orange of the two balls of light.  Whether it was one object or two is not known to me.  I wonder if others have seen this same object and can confirm what I observed.",

We live near Mobile and drive this route to and from the valley daily.  We were westbound, approaching the Queen Creek Road overpass at I-10E at approximately 1/4 mile.  At that  point, the road curves to the southwest as it crosses the interstate. As we were comming out of the curve, and at the same moment, we both saw a bright orange fireball traversing the sky originating from the south and moving in a direction toward the northwest.  This object was situated approximately 20 degrees off of the horizion and moving apparently parallel with the horizion.  It did have a long tail, approximately 10 times its diameter which was also bright orange.  We live 20 miles southwest of the valley (by way of the crow flys) separated from the valley by South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella range.  Thus,we experience very little reflective light from the metro, so viewing the night sky is a nightly occurrance.

This object was in the wrong part of the sky, and not moving like an arial flair.  For the past 10 days or so, Mars has been very bright in the southern sky.  By comparison, this orange fireball was at least 12 times the diameter of our view of Mars.  I phoned Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ within moments of the sighting from my celphone and later in the week.  They have no record of such a sighting.  If it was a meteor, it was a large one.  I thought it might have been a satelite comming out of orbit, but then again, it was so large.  Has the military reported anything missing that night?",

So I ran down to where they were and started talking to my friend, and then we saw this big shape like an egg almost as big as a house, it was like a bluish, silvery color. Then we ran to tell my mom and she came outside to see if she if she could see it too.  But it was gone so she went back in the house.  Right as soon as my mom went in the house we saw a shape again but it was sort of a more triangler egg shape.  Then the shape started to shoot out something in a line, and sort of looked like a lot of small triangles hooked together. The shape was like a silvery white color and was about as big as maybe a mansion.  The color of the  things that shot out of the shape were white. Then my friend and I ran back to our house to tell my mom again while my sister stayed back to see if she could see anything else.  But my mom still didn't see anything so she went back in the house.  After that we went to the spot to see if we could see anything else.  But we didn't except for the sky which lit up behind these houses we weren't sure if it had landed or not. Then about five minutes later my sister and our friend were walking back to the house and I thought I saw some red lights moving around in a tree or something.  I wasn't sure if it was anything so I called my sister and friend over to ask them if they saw anything but they said they didn't. So we walked back to the house.  Then after we went back to the house my sister went back to the spot where we had been seeing the shapes and said she saw the red lights moving in the trees too.\n\n\n\r\nMy friend and I were sitting on the curb in front of my house.

We noticed a flash of bluish-white light to the left of us, and then another flash of the same light to the right of us about 15 seconds later.  We assumed that it might just be a strange form of lightning.  We did find it a little strange because we usually see lightning behind our house, and the \"lightning\" seemed to just appear and move horizintally instead of the usual vertical lightning.  My friend and I then went into the house.  We were sitting on the couch, and looking out of the window when suddenly we saw an egg-shaped craft of the same color as the \"lightning\" in the sky a bit south of our house.  It was about the size of a house.  We ran out the front door and saw it disappear.  In hopes to see it again, we then ran down the street towards the direction in which we had seen the ship. My sister came out of the house.  We told her what we had seen and she joined us down the street.  It had been about one minute since the first sighting when we saw the craft again.  It was the same size, shape, and color.  It was a little further south of the area in which it first appeared.  The craft stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.  We ran back home and told my mother.  She came outside with us and we went back down the street to the place we had been during the second sighting.  We were out there telling my mother what happened for about 2-3 minutes.  She then went in the house. About a minute or two later, my friend and sister and I were standing in the same spot when a second craft appeared in the place where the first sighting had occured. This craft was the same shape as the first, but it was twice as big.  It was a light silver color.  An extremely bright, white beam of light shot and of the craft and sort of beamed around the ship.  There was some kind lightning-like bolts that seemed to be coming out of the beam of light which gave of white squiggly lines and small triangular light.  The ship disappeared and we ran back to my house to get my mother again.  She was outside with us for about 5 minutes but saw nothing and went back inside. My sister and friend and I then went back down the street to see if there was anything else to see.  Our neighborhood is surrounded by canyons and my sister noticed red lights flashing around some trees in a canyon about 4 blocks south of us.  My friend and i started walking back to my house and my sister followed.  A minute or two later, I went back down the street to see these red lights.  From the distance I was at from them, the lights were about the size of the tail lights of a car.  They were flashing in a running-motion (sort of like the motion christmas lights) around the trees.  I went back home.  A few minutes later, when my sister and friend and I went back to see the red lights, they were gone.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have spoken with this young witness, and we found her to be quite eloquent and serious-minded in her report.

The view includes the hills in Marin County as seen from near San Pablo bay in Contra Costa County.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a golden harvest moon, it gave off enough light to see the hills below it.  My impression was that it was the moon, but there was something off about it.  I commented in an IM that there was either a beautiful full moon or a UFO outside of my window.  It probably took me less than 30 seconds to type that and when I looked up again it was gone. I went outside and the sky was clear with stars clearly visable but I could not see the moon from my yard.  The object was moon sized but it didn't have the \"face\" in the moon, was more yellow than golden and seemed sort of speckled.

Then it was gone.  I remember getting a message that it was O.K. it was just a plane, not to worry.  I was not even upset, but looked at my watch when I came in the driveway and it was 22:55.  I had lost some time.  Even though I seemed to be in a non caring state I still wondered were it went and I thought I should be able to see it.  It was as if they gave me a message not too worry and not to think twice about what happened.  Later it kind of felt like it could not have happened, but it did.

I dismissed it as a plane since it did not move in relation to the star within 5 minutes.  Another red light \"dropped\" from the light approximately 1 inch below the primary light and then disappeared.  The primary light moved to the right slowly during a 5 minute period.  I grabbed my video camera and tripod hoping that the zoom feature may shed some light on what was causing this bright red light.  During the next 10 minutes, I observed the light \"pulsating\"- growing brighter like a light on top of a tower to almost disappearing in the clear sky then brighter again.  The light then gradually moved up above the neighboring star (during several minutes) and then stayed still. The light would dim to almost nothing then appear again.  Eventually, after 45 minutes, the light disappeared.  Please note that the sky was clear, no clouds or wind, no rain, and the neighboring star remained constant and visible during the observation dismissing the possibility of clouds interfering with the brightness of the light. I am a college educated, drug-free, teacher who has never seen anything like this before.  My husband is also drug-free ( I feel I must include that one) and very sane as well.

I went outside to have a smoke, as my mother and father are not smokers. After a short while I saw a beam of light coming down from the sky. The beam was only about 75 to 100 yards from where I was smoking. It seemed as if the light was searching for something; moving here and there, up the hill and then down the hill. At first, I thought it might have been a helicopter searching for something, but I didn\u2019t hear the sound of the blades cutting through the air. The sky was very dark blue and the stars were out, but when I tried to see where the light was coming from I couldn\u2019t see a thing. I thought at least I would see a silhouette of the thing from where the light came. I called to my nephew, who was about 9 or 10 years old at the time, to come outside.  He yelled back that he was watching something on television. A few minutes later the light went out. This was the strangest experience I ever had and remember it forever.

We were driving along the highway when, to the SSE of us, I saw in the sky what I thought was just a particularly bright star. After a few minutes, it seemed to divide into two smaller stars, which began to circle each other. I rolled down my window because I thought it might be a reflection playing tricks on me. When I still saw the two 'stars', I called the attention of my friends to it. We observed it for a minute or so, then decided to pull over and get out to have a better look. After we stood for a few minutes, each of the two 'stars' seemed to turn into a large white isosceles-type triagle, joined at two points kind of like a butterfly, like this : |&gt;&lt;| (The triangles were actually much longer top-to-bottom than that, but you get the idea) Eventually, the two triangles returned to the two stars, which eventually merged back into the one, whiched seemed to glow with a faint amber tint for the rest of the drive. We were at a loss for natural explanation, but we're no geniuses and I suppose there could be one. I don't know how it could be a terrestrial craft, and even if aliens and such really exist, it still seems an almost impossible design for a craft even with incredible technology, so who knows?

I'll never forget that night, for it was like it happened yesterday.  It was Wednesday night, 8:30pm, and this new show I had been anticipating to watch was starting to begin...I remember, seeing the credits listed at the start of the show, then all of the sudden my sister screamed my name, and it was in such a way that I thought something had happened to her. I ran upstairs, to find her looking out of our bedroom window, ran over to the window myself, to discover a saucer-shaped object approximately 45-50 feet hovering behind our backyard, outside our fence toward the canyon. The saucer was dark, but it's outline was really defined, and the bottom of the it was silver like in color with rotating flashing lights.  Anyway, the object began to give us a show. It continued to hover over the outskirts of our yard, and it's lights began to change, first blue to red, red to white, then white to orange, and it continued doing this.  Then all of the sudden, the object disappered, then reappeared, but this time in another form.  The object looked like the letter \"T\" lying on it's side.  Actually it's reminded me somewhat of a the little twisty key like object on a container of corned beef or spam, the kind attached to the container, used to open it; I hope this makes sense.  In any case, this \"T\" shaped object was dark, but very defined as well, and then it disappered, and the saucer-shaped object reappeared. The saucer continued to rotate it's lights a little while longer, going from red to blue, white to orange, and then it started to move, swaying side to side, going west. The craft contined going west, swaying side to side, until my sister and I could no longer see it, and then it was gone.  Realizing it had been there for a while, I looked at the clock after it left, and it was 8:55pm. How we ended up seeing the object in the first place, is that my sister saw this blue flash of light coming over the hill, east of our house (which is behind my parents' home). My sister mentioned two years ago--the first time we've discussed this matter in years, that when she first saw it coming over the hill, she immediately ran to lock the front door, then called me upstairs, which explains the fear in her voice when she yelled my name. To this day, I've always wondered how we ended up with this object hovering behind our backyard, but I will certainly carry this memory around with me the rest of my life.",

I was visiting the home of a friend, about a mile from where I used to live-- my parents' house.  My friend and I were sitting on the driveway, leaning against the garage door talking, and I happened to look up at the sky, when something unusual caught my attention, and we're talking about WAY up in the sky. This huge, I mean really HUGE object was moving across the sky at a very slow speed.  The object was not only enormous in size, but it was white, very bright, and shaped like a dome.  It reminded me of the Captiol dome, yet lying on it's side, with this white foggy type of mist trailing out of it. My friend both sat quietly and stared at this object moving across the sky, and then it disappeared.  Afterward, my friend and I turned to one another in amazement and that was that.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date may be approximate.

During the wee hours on Saturday morning July 7th approx 4:20 am, I was making overseas telephone calls and gazing out my east facing windows. I live on the 18th floor and have an unobstructed view of the mountains to the northeast, Burnaby City, and Mt. Baker. It was a clear crisp evening and I was looking directly out the window when I witnessed a huge fireball approx. 1/2 the size of the hay moon that evening. It streaked in an arch from  south to northeast for approx 6/7 seconds appearing to be directly over Burnaby (Although probably farther past) Judging by the size and the intensity (Red/Orange with short trail) My first thought was that it might have hit either mid BC or into the rockies??? I was unable to get any information on it the next day and local news desks received nothing over their wires? I've asked just about every night-owl and insomniac I know and no one observed it. I'm quite certain this was not the Linear A2 commet due to its size and visibility. It was stunning!...Anyone??!!!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>No other reports from Vancouver.

The car then started to stall and my grandfather  pulled off the right side of the road.  Just as he stoped it became like daylight out as a vary bright cigar shapped object appeared to the west of the car over a field. All I can remember is that it looked huge and was so bright that I was able to see all the picked corn rows in the field. It was a bright orange and with what looked like large port holes that were bright orange.  This may have been for 20 or 30 sec. and the next thing that I remember  is it being dark and that  I rolled down the window and stuck my head out looking up and seeing all the stars as it was a clear night.  We all said what happened and then just looked at each other.  My grandfather started the car and the radio came on and we went on to my aunts farm.  When we got there they wanted to know where we had been as we then realized that it was 22:00.   I have always wondered about this but as my mother is the only one  still living and she never wants to talk about it  I have never told enyone else about this event.

I was pointing out to her where I saw what I thought to be a fire on Waterworks hill on the northside of our small town of about 60,000 people.  As we were looking a flicker of amber light appeared.  I thought this wa rather odd so I  got out my very light sensiteve binoculars and waited to see if the flicker reappeared.  I was supprised to see the light appear again only this time the light changed to a brilliant white.  I continued to watch and found that the light would change appearance.  About every 20 to 60 seconds light changed color, location and duration although the light flashes only lasted a maximum of about 10 seconds per incedent.  The light firsh was first amber, then white then amber then amber then red   then blue...  I had thought that perhaps these were left over fireworks but the short flash of most of the lights and the intesity considering that it was about 15 miles away made it seem unlikely.  As I contiunued to watch the light then moved behind the hill and projected a beem of   light upward in a \"V\" formation  so that all that was light was the air itself.  Then positioning itself back atop of the hill it flashed two short green flashes.  About a minute and a half later it then flashed a combined blue and red combination light.  As I waited there were no more light flashes for about 10 minutes then out from behind the hill a craft slowly appeared from behind west side of the hill.  This craft had a stack of three amber lights horizontally and vertically.  In the center very brilliant white lights strobed from left to right.  It then changed direction and started moving slowly north toward the small community of Saint Ignatius, Montana.  I watched it slowly drift north for about 3 to 5 minutes.  A comercial airliner then flew directly over my home and within seconds the unidentified craft made a extreamly quick turn to the east and accerlerated.  I would say the ! craft by that time was 30 miles away and during its acceleration covered 10 to 15 miles in about 3 to 5 seconds and disappeared bihind a group mountains somewhere in the St. Ignatiius Valley which is in the Mission Mountain range area.  I have never before seen a craft that I felt that I could not explain but both my wife and I were and are baffed. I was not going to report this for fear of being thought of as I may be accused of causing a mass halucionination with my wife but our local radio station that they had received several calls from people around the Missoula area that a green light had been seen moving about our city late Saturday afternoon.  This gave me the courage to tell what I and my wife had seen.",

We were driving from Minnesota to New Jersey, and I believe it would have been I-80 or I-90 that we were traveling on in Ohio. The incident occurred in Ohio while driving on the highway in a very isolated area.  My husband was driving, and myself, sister and daughter were sound asleep in the car.  My husband said that it had been hovering along side of us in the car for quite a while, and he was stunned by it to the point he couldn't speak to wake me up.  Finally, when he hit me in the leg to wake me, I instantly sat up and saw this thing with bright lights.  If I remember correctly, it was an open isolated area with open fields around it and I would guess that it was hovering along the highway over the field. It was incredible, and I was so excited I wanted to get the camera but it was in the trunk.  I jumped toward the back seat to awaken my sister who sat up to see it.  It was as though once we were all awake and saw it that it moved behind the car over the highway and hovered behind us.  It was as though it knew we were all aware of its presence.  I looked ahead to see an overpass approaching where I wanted to stop so I could get my camera.  When I looked back, it was gone.  My husband said that it flew away in the blink of an eye.  My sister was traumatized by it, and even at 28 years old will start crying when the subject is brought up.  I don't think my daughter remembers it at all. The strange part of it also was that my husband was driving down the highway the entire time fixated on this UFO and not even paying attention to the road, yet he kept the car perfectly straight.  The time was asked above, and I can only say that it was a couple of minutes from when I had been awakened.  My husband on the other hand, said that it had been following him for quite a while...  Even though my sister and myself were sound asleep, it was so incredibly huge and bright that the second we opened our eyes we saw it right there in front of us.  There was no pointing to look at any object, you could not miss it. It had extremely bright lights, but I do not remember it having a \"plasma\" appearance as described in some sightings.  I believe that the pictures that described it that way was a result of the camera or the fact that it was moving very fast that made it appear to look blurry.  It was approximately the size of a football stadium. I called the (800)SIGHTINGS number to report it and left a message, and if they have record of my call you could determine the date that this took place.  They never called me back.  It was a couple of months after our sighting that I reported it. In summary, I have to say that when I was looking for my camera and considering pulling over...that the only other thoughts that were going through my head were if we stop under this bridge so I can get the camera out of the trunk...will they abduct us.  They really were that close that I was starting to get worried and why they were following us like that... FYI...  My cousin, ((name delted)), who sits on the International ((deleted--aviations organization)) (or something like that), referred me to this website to report it after a family gathering where it came up in conversation.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Emitted beams, Electrical or magnetic effectsufo spotted 9-19-96 on the shores of Lake Erie in Avon Lake, Ohio, United States of America\n\r\nOn the evening of September 19th, 1996, I was doing a mobile patrol behind the ((energy)) company in Avon Lake, Ohio.  It was a warm evening, and the lake was very calm.  I began my patrol starting in at the east gate, where we - security was ordered, and then continued on thorough the patrol in the company van.  The sky was clear and starry, and I could see where the sun had set beyond the horizon line, northwest of where I was driving along the shoreline road provided.  After I made it past the horseshoe pond on the east end of the plant's outside area, I began heading toward the west end of the plant, checking designated spots along the way.  Once I made it to the west end of the plant near the fence and public park next door, I checked around a bit and saw that nothing was wrong.  At that point, the ufo had not yet appeared.  So after I turned the van around and began to backtrack my route, I came around the west end of the roadway at the sharp turn on the west end of the plant and headed eastward, when a bright light over the lake caught the corner of my eye.  I stopped to see what it was, and there was this weird craft hovering over the water at approximately two hundred yards off shore, and about one hundred and fifty feet or so above the water.  It was super bright white and very quiet, having seven straight pertrusions coming off of the rectangle center of the craft.  Each pertrusion was exactly the same length and thickness, and each one pointed in a different direction.  For a moment, I thought it was someone playing a trick on me, so I got scared and rolled up my window.  Finally, after three minutes of watching this thing do nothing, I began to continue on with my patrol.  So I started moving the van with my foot still on the break.  I moved it about fifteen or twenty feet before I decided to stop and take one last look at the object.  When I did, it was gone!  Then I really got suspicious and began looking around the water and the pier below the cliff that I was driving! along, when I noticed something moving around by the rocks almost near the shoreline.  I saw a long black semi-cylinderical shaped object moving around down there, that turned around showing a bright white football shaped light directly toward me, as if it were looking at me.  Then suddenly, the thing turned around again, pointed upward, and darted off into the northeast sky, vanising into the stars within three seconds after it took off.  It never once made any sound or expelled any streams of fuel gasses.  After that, for about two weeks my mind was in total confusion.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't take my mind off of the thing at all.  Even to this day, I think about it and watch the night skies.  The following year, some friends and I went back to that approximate spot to see if any other alien crafts would come down; but we had no luck.",

Some of the spectators reported said sighting as if \"the comet had appeared out of nowhere, like \"when you see ships appearing out of 'wormholes' in movies\". That same night, attacks on fowl and rabbits  by the ill-famed chupacabras (or goatsucker)were reported in the vicinity of Barrio Jobos, on the NNW side of Isabela's municipality - photographs of the attacked dead animals and the torn-up cages have been taken and are available to serious investigators.

It was spherical and had multi-colored lights along the base that were chasing each other, and it had a red ball on the top. The body was dark, and I didn't see the underside of it because of the treeline. I realized a split second later that it couldn't be the spaceneedle because that particular building is about 15 miles away, and this  sphere was between 1/4 and 1/2 mile away. I had my windows cracked open because it was a warm night, and I don't have a radio in my car, but I didn't hear anything that sounded mechanical or electrical. As I went down the road I lost track of it in the treeline. I didn't see it take off, but as this happened within a couple blocks of my house I went to go get my husband, and after I located him there was no sign of it.

I continued observing the object to make sure it wasn't just mylar balloons, but the object remained stationary,  where as balloons will drift with the air current.

About 160 NM east to the Jacksonville coast FL, in the Atlantic Ocean, heading SW (210\u00bastm), we saw, at the begining, like a cream color, small oval, moving east to west, heading (110\u00bastm) about 25\u00ba up of my left horizon, and making light curves and little circles in an up parabolic track. Then stop moving about 80\u00ba up. At that moment the cream color oval switched to a massive super bright white light (hallogen light) like the sheriff helicopter lite. And just the light started moving like searching. I could see the shadow of my left arm inside the cockpit (weird!!!). I saw a giant cloud forming around the lower and the upper side of the light (like a mushroon upside down). Suddenly the light turned off, but the big cloud remained there loosing the bright. We flow for an hour and ten minutes more at 300 Kts, (about 300 miles) and still we could see the cloud. We couldn\u00b4t see any kind of body object, or object aproximation because of the super bright of the light.

I also observed a strange aura/trail around it similar to the heat that rises off a hot road. no sounds, seemed also to have a slight wobble; maybe caused by the aura, as it seemed to blur the outline.  object silvery, seemed to have black on it; shape seemed to resemble a trashcan (or R2D2 from star wars) Continued to approach, and passed overhead and behind me and I lost sight of it.  observed other people in the cars around me also looking into the sky as they passed me.  total time of sighting less than 7-8 seconds",

The aircraft  two commerical jets either 737's or 747's with no visible markings just a plain white body. The other aircraft wasn't quite white it was a greyish metallic color with a weird shape which i couldn't make out. The only way to describe the third aircraft was whale like, big up front like a whale with it's mouth wide open and the rest of the craft was normal in comparison with other big commerical aircraft. I was using binoculars 10 x 50 to observe the aircraft. The sky was clear except for the chemtrails the three planes where leaving. I put the craft around 20,000 feet moving west to east at a very slow speed for craft at that altitude. What really caught my eye was this strange orb looking object sitting stationary on the same path as the craft flew by. The orb which was reflecting sunlight was emitting a light. It was as if you where looking straight into a very powerful flashlight. And even though the sun was still out and hitting the object the light was very bright. After I observed the orb for a few minutes it just vanished. I waited until it got darker to see if maybe i was looking at a star but ther was no star bright enough in that part of the sky.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The third aircraft the witness describes is not inconsistent with an EC-135, which has a bulbous forward section to its fuselage.  We do not know what the bright object was.  Given that the sighting occurred approximately 45 minutes before the unannounced launch of an ICBM, probably from a U. S. submarine, we wonder whether the presence of an EC-135 eastbound over Texas may have had something to do with that launch.  PD",

At the height of the event, it was moving  as fast as a jet across the sky and the head was very bright.  Suddenly the streak (tail) disapeared and about a second later apearred on the opposite side of the head (in a 10'clock position).  At that moment it stopped moving downwards and seemed to stay in a relatively stable position moving slightly upwards again in the distance.  After this it just got smaller and smaller as it faded towards the horizon.  All in all this occurred between 9:05 and 9:25 pm with the most dramatic part being about 30 seconds.  VERY dramatic and bright - I was walking across the Granville st. bridge from work and myself, a co-worker and at least 15 other people stopped and stood viewing what was happenning.  I phoned the news stations when I got home, but although they said they had recieved calls about it, without camera footage they did not care.  In retrospect it seemed to have been a comet or meteor entering and exiting the atmosphere with the moment when the tail suddenly changed direction probably being the time when it was closest to the Earth (and land/water).  Actually scared the #*!@ out of me during that moment because it was so bright and fast (and probably a HUGE object up there).\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>NUFORC received a telephone call from a Vancouver, B.C., radio station, reporting that witnesses had reported the event to them, too.

I could not sleep so I got up and look at the clock and it was 02:30.  I walked outside to the campfire to have a smoke.  Earlier that evening there were thunderstorms, but the skies were clear at the time of the sighting.  After about ten minutes a flash lit up the campground as if it was daylight, I look up and saw what appeared to be a shooting star with a long tail behind it moving Northeast. It was not as fast as your normal shooting star, because if I had actually seen a flash from a real shooting star against the ground, by the time I look up the star would have already been gone.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 7 seconds. About 2-3 minutes later I heard one single boom. Then I knew for sure it was not a shooting star because I had heard what appeared to be an explosion. Earlier that evening, my family and I were watching lightening flashes and counting the seconds after the flash.  I told my son I believe for every second the lightening is a mile away.  If this is true than the explosion had to be between 120-180 miles away. I looked on the CNN website today to see if we had lost any satellites, but there were none. My brother had asked me how high I thought the object was, the only thing I could tell him is it appeared to be much lower than a shooting star. There were no running lights and the object  turned into a orange fireball with a tail of 1/3 of the skies length.",

We; myself and 3 or 4 other surfers heard an aircraft overhead and we spotted at about 750 to 1,000 ft. a triangular craft pure black no markings and very thin approximately 3 ft. thick. It was silent.  What we heard was above it a twin engine civilian craft that looked as though it was \"checking out\" the triangle.  The triangle was the shape of a hang-glider but rigid wings and had two small approx 2ft. propellers at the trailing edge of the triangle about 2-3 feet from each of the two points at the rear.  As the triangle was only going about 40 mph the twin engine overtook it quickly and as the triangle went inland over the land without a change in altitude the twin engine that was about 750 ft. above the triangle banked off.  The triangle kept going inland. It went right over our heads and was flying level and was not gliding.  It was under power as proven by its level and slow flight for a long time.  It was not an equalateral triangle but had a trailing edge that was smaller than the leading edges.  It looked unmanned as it was very thin and if a man had been lying down inside of it it would have been very cramped as the total thickness looked to me about 2 feet.  I mentioned the sighting to the other surfers out there with me and I said what the heck was that? One replied a \"stealth\" obviously referring to the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter of which I have seen both in flight doing a couple of fly bys at a Stockton, CA airshow a few years ago.  This was way smaller than the stealth bomber and fighter and was very small.  I spoke to a family relative who worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in LA at the skunk works for several years and he said that the drones they were working on had wooden propellers 2 ft. long made by a local civilian.  The question is why would the military fly a craft over civilians in mid-day at such a low altitude and go over su! rfers a known surfing spot and then go over land?  There was no attempt to hide it. I reported it to the FAA at the Monterey airport and the air traffic controller said to me that if I spotted it again to please let him know.  Since I am 50 years old and have never seen anything even close to this before I mentioned to him that it was highly unlikely that I would ever see it again.",

The first time I saw it I thought it was strange but blew it off simply as stars.  However, since I've seen it again, thought it might be worth sharing. Not really sure if it is a UFO per se, but it is definately not like anything I've seen before. Would love it if someone could explain what it is. Around about the same time it was before, 4:00-4:30 a.m., I went outside for a smoke because I was having problems sleeping.  Outside, over I 43 west of Beloit, going towards Milwaukee, there was one very big extremely bright and intense white light in the sky and a smaller light on it's lower right side, stationary in the sky.  I noticed it right away because as I stepped outside the garage it was located directly in front of me.  I looked around to see if there were any other \"stars\" in the sky, because the sun was about to come up and I was surprised to see such a huge bright light at that time of the day.  As I turned back around, to look at the bright light and the smaller one, I saw another smaller white light  coming from the east side of the big bright light moving west towards it.  (It was small like the other light on it's lower right side.)  When it got in a position to where it made all the three lights form a triangle, it stopped.  Maybe 2 minutes after that, (still smoking so it wasn't that long)I heard and saw an airplane fly towards the smaller light that had just recently moved towards the big light.  As the airplane got closer to the light, the bright light in the center, changed shapes, it got oblonged and grew 2 armlike looking things from it (like a stick person without the legs). While it was doing this, the light got really intense.  The airplane went around it.  Then, not more than 1 or 2  minutes later (still smoking the same cigarette), another airplane to the right of me this time came from behind me, and flew towards the triangle and again, when it got close, the big light in the middle got oblonged and the arms came out, and the brightness increased. The airplane flew past it.  I came inside the house but went back out just before the sun came out (about 45 minutes later) to see if it could be seen in the day light.  When the sun came out, I could still see it. (It was that bright!) But it didn't stay long.  It got smaller and smaller and just disappeared, in a matter of seco! nds.  If anyone lives along, or near the I 45 freeway between Beloit and Milwaukee Wisconsin, check it out, it's a neat sight.  Like I said this is the second time that I have seen it, and both times were early in the morning around 4:00-4:30 a.m. before sunset.",

Perfect 90 degree banks at incredible speed!!!\n\r\nDuring my days at college, my roomates and i decided to visit, the ((deleted)) temple in moundsville, wv. following an old dirt road through the woods leading us there, i noticed a strange hum coming from outside the car. I pulled over to a place where the dirt road ran beside a small crick. The sky was perfectly clear, and EVERY star was visible. We were at a particular opening in the woods, were you could see a good bit of the sky. At about 10:30 pm I noticed the humming was coming from the sky, and looking up, I saw 5 distinguishable crafts approx. 1,000 ft in the air, i'm not the best judger of distance when it comes to te sky. 1 hovering motionless in the center of the sky, and the other four were flying around it at astonishing speeds. The intriging part about them was, the fact that they were circling the center craft and banking immaculate 90 degree turns without slowing down. I noticed a slight visual disruption directly behind the 4 crafts, as if staring through gasoline fumes where your vision is distorted by waves of exhaust. The crafts appeared to be triangular shaped, distinguished by 3 blue lights at each point, and one larger and brighter white light in the center. They appeared to be holding their position the entire time were there, as if they were spying, or maybe waiting for something. We decided to leave because we all had class early next morning and it was an hour and a half drive back to the school. As we were leaving, headed down this old dirt road barely large enough for a single car, which also I might add, is lucky to be traveled twice a day; we were forced off the road and into the grass by 3 large oncoming vehicles. The first, an undercover state police explorer - as it appeared to be, and the other two were a camoflauged military hummer, and a large transport van also in camo. The van had 2 large sattelite dishes on it and more antennaes than i could count. Go figure/?? If theres anyone else out there, that may have seen the same spectacle in the sky near moundsville around that time, please let me know your out there. I've made an interesting hypothesis about the humming coming from the sky. Have you ever hit a tuning fork or a cymbal from a drum set and placed it extremely close to your ear, and heard the low level hum that the sound waves radiate? It's almost unearthlike, and that is the EXACT sound I heard! I believe that this particular craft uses sound wave generation to either induce motion as in forward or reverse, OR, just as a means of hovering. Sound is measured in decibles, which is basically described sound pressure level. PRESSURE is the key, i believe they can force themselfs in any direction by controlled bursts of sound waves or magnetic waves. The government cannot keep a lid on this any longer, as long as everybody knows whats goin on. Then we'll all know who was directly involved in it for quite some time now; and you probably hear their excuse being: \"We didn't want to create a widespread panic...\" Sure what would happen if everybody suddenly realized there IS other life in the galaxy?? People would revolt against society, taxes wouldn't be paid, people wouldn't go to work, THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY ON YOU!!!! And more importantly; They would no longer be top dogs; let alone even be able to try to cover anything else up. Think about it for a while, sooner or later you'll start to realize what there up to.. Hopefully its not all too late for us when it does become apparent... Thanks for your time, and continue to live free and intelligently!

To the right of the car, we both noticed something strange in the sky; three triangular objects.  What drew our attention to them was the fact that there seemed to be a center object (larger than the others) hovering, while the 2 objects surrounding it moved rapidly from either side of it. These objects had lights at all 3 corners (two red, one blue) and a larger white light in the center.  What was so amazing about these objects was their ability to hover, as well as their incredible speed.  We stopped and got out of our car to get a better look, but within about 5-10min they were gone.  A little later in the evening, closer to 10pm, we went out again to see if we could spot these objects.  As we drove on the interstate closer to Raleigh, they appeared again.  It seemed to me that we saw between 3-5 of these at various locations. Again, we got out of the car (with camera in hand) and one of the objects flew fairly close to us to allow a better look.  This object appeared to be similar to the center object we had seen earlier.  Also triangular, it appeared to have two very bright white lights at the top-most point, with red lights on the bottom two.  In the center was again a larger white light, and right above these were two strange markings of white light (resembeling &lt;&lt;).  This object came close to us, but made absolutely no sound whatsoever. In total, over about 1-2 hours, we witnessed between 3-5 of these objects.  While I was skeptical, I just can't explain what it was that we saw.  Another strange thing was that there was a much higher amount of air traffic (airplanes) in the area than we normally see. Though I can't be sure, some did appear to be military.",

There was 15-20 non flashing lights gathered together.  My boyfreind said it was planes but as we were driving they did not move at all in the sky. They were not stars nor plane lights so as we continued to drive there were cars lined up along the shoulers on the turnpike.  So then we pulled over along the shoulder to.  We got out of the car and looked up into the sky and stood there for about 3 minutes looking at the circular lights above us.  Cars were pulled all over for at least a 1/2 mile in front of us and a 1/2 mile in back of us. We spoke with the people behind us and the people in front of us.  We all were saying it was the crazist thing we have ever seen.  Then the lights started to disappear slowly going upward and then there were two lights left and they just disappeared to.",

The objects flew in a straight path for a few seconds and then crossed paths (presumably going above and below each other).   Then they straightened out and exited our field of vision. The objects were identifiable as \"boomerangs\" (totally lit in the sky).  They had no recognition lights.  They were not commercial airliners.  They were not military fighters (wrong configuration and would not be totally lit).  I have worked on military aircraft in the past and know their configurations and characteristics.

My youngest sister (age 11 in 1966) and brother (age 8), and a boy friend (age 9?), were alone at our farm house 9 miles from Coyanosa, Texas (near Pecos).  They were looking south and saw one saucer flying close to the house and close to the ground.  It flew from west to east and landed 1/4 mile from the house in the Coyanosa Draw (a dry creek).  It then took off and flew away.  Myself (age 17 in 1966) and my brother (age 15) arrived at home at suppertime and were told about the UFO.  We believed what the kids said.  We went to the creek bed to see the landing site.  I walked directly to the site. My brother rode his horse but the horse would not approach the site...he had to also walk to the site.  The weeds/brush were flattened in a circular shape as if something about 30-40 feet in diameter had crushed them.  There was no evidence of fire or heat, and no major indentations other than the crushed weeds/brush.  I walked back to the house and called the Midland/Odessa airport control tower (about 120 miles away) to ask about radar observations or unusual aircraft and they reported that they saw nothing out of the ordinary.  We occasionally discuss this UFO at family gatherings.  To this day the three (now adults) who actually saw the UFO swear that this event happened, and my brother and I did see the spot where the UFO landed and took off.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

Police received about 15 calls, 75 cars stopped on NJ Turnpike to watch, even the police themselves saw it.  Newark airport, National Weather Service, and McGuire AFB all report no explanation.  No planes, no unusual weather, no air force. Late-night Carteret light show a mystery 07/16/01 BY DORE CARROLL STAR-LEDGER STAFF A drowsy mother in Carteret saw the flickering golden lights in the sky and ran for her camera. A hard-boiled Navy veteran traveling the New Jersey Turnpike spotted the slow-moving, bright-yellow V-formation and pulled his car to the shoulder to get a better look. Police officers on patrol at 12:40 a.m. yesterday couldn't believe their eyes. Within the hour, Carteret police dispatchers said they heard from at least 15 callers reporting strange orange flares blazing high above the Arthur Kill. The eerie glow had people at backyard barbecues mesmerized, with heads upturned and mouths agape. Almost 75 vehicles pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike to watch the spectacle. But no one seems to know what caused the luminous vision. Police could not identify the source of the lights, and Newark International Airport authorities reported no unusual flight patterns. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service said nothing in the atmosphere would have caused the bright disturbance, and an airman at McGuire Air Force Base said none of their military planes were in the air at that hour. Whatever it was that lit up the sky above Carteret was by all accounts weird. \"It wasn't fireworks, and it couldn't have been a hot-air balloon, not at night near the airfield,\" said Steven Vannoy, who pulled over on the turnpike with his girlfriend on their way home to Perth Amboy. \"What we saw last night qualifies as a UFO. It was an unidentifiable flying object.\" A Carteret police sergeant on duty called the State Police and neighboring departments in Linden and Woodbridge to find out what was causing the strange glow, but he said none had received reports of the lights. Bob Wanton, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, had no explanation for the lights. \"Weatherwise, there was nothing that would have caused it,\" he said. The aurora borealis, a spectacular show of light high in the northern hemisphere, is seldom visible in New Jersey, said Wanton. The lights normally appear in the winter, he said. \"It's very unusual for the northern lights to come down this far, especially at this time of year,\" he said. On Staten Island, a spokeswoman for the 123rd precinct in the Tottenville section suggested the display might have come from a nightclub on Arthur Kill Road that frequently uses search lights for promotions. The club had been ordered closed by a judge on July 11 and its phone was disconnected yesterday. Airman First Class Andre Steverson said no planes from McGuire Air Force Base were flying at that time. An operations manager at Newark International Airport said there were no reports of unusual activity and said the lights \"could have been almost anything,\" from a group of military helicopters on flight exercises to a blimp. Maybe, said David Stich, who saw the bursts of light from his back yard in Carteret. But those flares didn't look to him like spotlights or anything else he could recognize. \"I never in my life saw anything like it,\" said Stich, a lifelong Carteret resident accustomed to the roar and flight path of aircraft from Newark. He compared the lights to volleyballs, dwarfing the surrounding stars, and said they clearly moved in formation. Around the corner, Pam Russell's husband woke her to see the show. She saw a diamond-shaped pattern in the sky and noticed smaller lights leading the pack and bringing up the rear. \"I ran for my camera,\" said Russell. \"But they disappeared.\" Afterward, she said, the skies were dark and silent.\n\r\nEND ARTICLE))",

It was a very clear starry night (which is very usual in our part of the world) when my attention was drawn to a passenger aircraft flying over (I would like to point out that I like watching them fly past,night or day, beause I have a huge interest for Aviation).  We have an International airport in the city, so I guessed Commercial Airlines used it as a waypoint, thus frequently passing overhead. \n\r\nAnyway, on this occasion, a strange thing happened.  As I stared at the aircraft's strobes flashing away, an object like a star (but without the twinkle) suddenly appeared at some distance behind the aircraft.  This object then suddenly sped up towards the airplane at incredible speed and stopped right behind it, then it started moving from side to side, as if studying the airplane.  It would move back abruptly, then suddenly flash forward, but never overtook the aircraft. \n\r\nWhat fascinated me was the irregularity in speed and distance to the airliner.  There was no pattern that would suggest some sort of light reflection or something like that.  \n\r\nAnyway, after trailing the Aircraft for about 20-25 seconds, it changed direction completely to the right, traveled some distance,(to scale with the aircraft, I would say about 10-15 lengths of the wingspan) then simply vanished. \n\r\nI continued to stare at the airplane until it vanished, thinking it might uccur again but nothing happened. (Sorry about the date. I'm not even sure of the year and month; it was just a wild guess.)\n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD",

I am an 18 year old college student who never saw UFOs before or thought much about them. \n\r\nThe sky was blue and there were few clouds at the time. The circle of the sun was completely behind the slant of the roof and only the corona of the sun was visible to me. Around the corona, I saw from 7 to 11 white lights. Some were hovering and about 3 were darting quickly and suddenly in random directions. \n\r\nAfter a few minutes, they drifted away. They seemed to go behind the roof so I could not see them anymore. I saw them between the roof and trees that were nearby. They were so close to the sun that I suppose I would not have looked up unless the circle of the sun was hidden by the roof and did not hurt my eyes. The lights were a steady white which stood out among the blue of the sky. They reminded me of diamonds (such as a diamond with a silver background) that were sparkling. The lights were not well defined to be a particular shape but I think they were circular. They were unlike anything I've seen before. When I heard the next day that other sightings had occurred in New Jersey, I felt I should report what I had seen. These UFOs were in no particular formation and did not blink.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have not received any other reports from this area of New Jersey for this time period.

It caught my attention, either because of its unusual brightness or a vague perception of movement.  While I was watching it, it suddenly disappeared.  My wife had not been watching, and I described to her what I had seen, and commented on its oddity.  A few minutes later, I observed the same light.  I pointed towards it, and said \"there!\"  My wife looked up and saw the light.  It remained for approximately 3-5 seconds, then again suddeny disappeared.  It was too large and bright to be an airplane, and the suddeness of its disappearance was its most remarkable feature.

I live quite a ways from the city and there is very little light polution so I often look at the stars.  I was gazing at the stars and was drawn to the ENE sky by an extremely large light.  My first reaction was that it was the headlight of an airplane especially since it was in the direction of Cleveland Hopkins airport.  The main light was so large it  amazed me, It was the size of a cars headlight when viewed in oncoming traffic.  Along with the main light were two other lights more star sized, with the main light they formed a triangle with the two smaller lights at the bottom.  I watched this grouping of lights for at least 15 minutes trying to figure out what they were.  I concluded they were not airplanes as they did not move or change size.  The lights did not twinkle like stars so I thought possibly  they were planets, but the odd arrangement and the extremely large light did not make sense.  I often look at the stars and am familuar with most of the constellations so to see this in the sky continues to puzzle me.",

We were standing outside of our patrol vehicles.  My supervisor called my attention to a \"bright star\" low in sky to the north east.  Upon seeing this very bright, red twinkling object I first thought that it was a planet,  then the object faded out and disappeared.  We thought that maybe a cloud had passed in front of this object that we were still assuming was a planet or star, although the night was relatively clear as one could plainly see the cresent moon.  Approximately five minutes later, this object reappeared at what appeared to be a higher altitude and began to slowly become very dim and then very bright, as if someone were playing with a dimmer switch on a light bulb.  I retrieved a pair of 10 by 25 binoculars that I keep with my duty gear and again looked at the object.  Through the binoculars, three seperate objects could be seen in a tight triangle formation.  By this time, around 0500hrs, vehicles were passing by our location, but noone elese seemed to notice the object, as it looked like a \"normal\" star unless one watched it for a few minutes and noticed it's strange behavior.  At dawn, around 0530hrs, the object seemed to stabilize at a constant brightness and ended the pulsing effect.  At 0545hrs, with sufficient sunlight,  when looking at the object through my binoculars,  the three lights were still distinct, although now they were a bright white color, with what appeared to be some sort of solid object behind them, visible only through the binoculars.  At this time, the moon and this object were the only visible objects in the sky, but by this time, if one did not know where to look, one would probably not notice it.  By 0600,  with the glare of the rising sun, the object was no longer visible.  I have six years of law enforcement/security experience, with many nights being spent on the overnight shift.  I, nor my supervisor,  who has over ten! years e xperience, have never seen anything like this object.  I have seen satellites and had an astronomy course in college and do not remember studying any know heavenly objects visible from earth that act in this manner.  Approximately six months ago I did see something similar but dismissed it as an aircraft or figment of my imagination because it only lasted a few seconds.",

This Diamond shaped craft looked sa if it was in trouble like it was going down but as it fell further and further down alot of smaller craft shot out of it and up through the atmosphere.  The larger diamind shaped craft then vaporised.  The Diamind shaped craft looked like it was a green that waved into a blue then into a red like one of those stickers you get on a VHS video.

The site at an elevation of approximately 350' was close to the ocean which was directly to the east. 2 Fishing vessels were observed on the ocean earlier in the evening but had moved from the area. The area is within 3nm of an airport and also a transatlantic route for aircraft. Equipped with a 5\" wide field refractor I was joined by 2 friends at 10:00EST and spent an hour touring the totally clear skies looking at different star and galaxy formations. We were also observant of numerous \"high flyers\" (aircraft), satellites and the occasional \"shooting star\". At 11:00, one of my friends spotted an elliptical light toward the ocean and brought our attention to it. It moved very slowly from North to South, then at the same slow speed and direction descended. It ascended and headed directly due east until it completely faded from view. While transitting from North to South, it was observed through the telescope which revealed an elliptical source of light at the \"front\" and a blinking light towards the back. First thought: aircraft, possibly helicopter. Not likely. Myself and one of the other people present are experienced observers, also involved in the aviation industry and knowledgable of aircraft activities in the area. Observed numerous aircraft that night, including trainers. Altitude and flight direction/pattern were not that of normal commercial aircraft operations or trainers. No other military presence in this area either. Simply could not classify what we were looking at.",

The jet seemed to be on an aproach to Will Rogers Airport.  It was heading due south directly over our location.  The jet was flying low, perhaps 2000 to 2500 feet above the ground.  I was the first to notice an other object just off the plane's left side.  The object was about 75 to 100 feet from the left side and keeping pace with the plane.  At first I thought I was seeing a reflection in my glasses. I asked the other person with me if they saw it too.  They did. We watched for about 45 seconds, untill the jet and object disappeared behind some trees to our south.  The object had no lights of it's own and was only lighted by the street lights below.  The object looked to be cigar shaped, 25 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The object was gray in color and made no sound that we could hear over that of the jet.  The object made to change in direction other  than to pace the plane.  The weather was clear with a few stars showing, wind was from the south at 5 MPH.  Temp was in the 90's  Myself nor the other person had been drinking or taking any drugs.",

The sky was clear and you could see a lot of stars.  My brother in law pointed to the sky and said \"what is that\".  I looked to the sky and saw a (V) formation of six or seven white lights that almost looked like shooting stars but slower. The (V) formation was missing two lights on one end to make a perfect (V).  The formation looked a little blurry to me. The formation moved from the ocean side (South) to the north, high in the sky, maybe out of the atmosphere. The formation moved very fast lasting about three seconds.  Iam a Vietnam veteran and retired Police Officer.  I have lived near a military air base most of my life.  I have Never seen anything like this in my life!  About 11pm I called the Patrick Air Force base, which is near by, and spoke to the operator at the base.  I told her what I saw and asked her who I could talk to about what I saw.  She advised me that the Air Base did not investigate UFO sightings and advised me to call the Sheriffs office, which I did.  After telling the dispatcher what we saw, she said she had no other reports of what I saw and asked if I wanted to see a Police Officer and I stated no.  At aprox 3am I could not sleep thinking about what I saw and called the Sheriffs dispatcher again.  This time I talked to a male operator.  I asked him if he had any reports of strange lights and he stated \"oh yes\" lots of reports!  I told him what I saw and he had a quick change of attitude and asked if I had been drinking?  I told him no.  He said what you saw were fireworks and asked if I wanted him to send a Police Officer and I said no . I hope some eone else saw what we saw!",

The only descrepancy was that it did not appear to have any wings. It looked like the space shuttle coming in for a landing but without the V shaped wings. It tool approx 1 min to come into view and then leave the other way. There were other commercial jets in the sky directly behind the object. I beleive it was a military or test vehicle but have never seen anything like this before.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The witness provides four digital photographs of the object.  It is seen leaving two contrails behind each wing, so we presume that the object is powered by air-breathing engines.  The object has the general appearance of a military jet fighter.  We do not know what type of aircraft it is, but we do not believe it is a UFO.  PD",

It was about 7:30 PM, and the sky was mostly sunny with few clouds.  As I was driving I saw what first I thought was a plane, so I ducked my head down so as to view it, since it was just out of my sight as I sat in a semi-rigid driving position.  What I observed was a light, pulsating from orange to blue to yellow to pink, which was slowly streaking across the sky from the west to the east at an angle of 270*.  When the object became perpendicular to the interstate it split apart from one object into three separate objects with the same properties in an equilateral triangular pattern.  The three objects then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from my view.  Once I had witnessed this I continued on the interstate until I reached the rest area just north of Onawa at which I pulled off to see if anyone else had seen what had happened since it occurred less than five minutes beforehand.  When I got out of my car, other people were standing on the sidewalk and from what I overheard it sounded like they were talking about what I had seen.  I walked by them without asking them though since I didn't want to sound crazy, because I wouldn't want someone walking up to me at a rest stop talking about a UFO.  I am a Cadet of the United States Army, and have taken college astronomy courses so I know what I saw was not Mercury, a \"shooting star\", Venus, or any other astronomical body.  What I saw reflected light and emitted light that changed colors, and although the sun was starting to set it was still light enough out that the stars would not be visible, nor was the sun a hindrance since I wasn't looking into the western sky.",

(elev.3195 ft. &amp; part of the White Mountain National Forest), in North Conway, NH, I was gazing several miles out at the remainder of light from the dusk sky. At best guess, I'd say between 700-1000 feet above the highest peek and perfectly aligned with the horizon, one bright, star-like light/size appeared from no where. The first light split into a second identical light and quickly moved horizontaly southward leaving a very faint and momentary light stream behind it. It moved about 300ft to the left of the still lit, first light and came to a complete and sudden stop. At this point, the second light did the exact same thing as the first (eg: same split, same size, same light trail, same distance, same sudden stop) leaving three identical lights above the mountain for about three seconds. Then, once in position the first light dissapeared (much like someone switching off a light), followed by the second, and then the third. Since there was still enough dusk light in the sky, I scanned the sky for the silouet of a plane, a glider or anything that might have given off such a light.......the sky was perfectly clear, with the exeption of a few faint stars just beginning to appear.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

It was bike week at Laconia N.H, so, there were alot of people around. Usually the main bar is buisier, but we had a band out in the back of the restaraunt so there was not one soul on the front deck. Anyways, while takeing the garbage out, I looked up in the sky, as I often do, and noticed a star that was unusually bright sitting next to venus, which sits in the same spot every night at that same time in the southern sky, or pretty close to it. The star seemed very bright and as I said to my self, \"boy, that's a weird star?!?\" the brightness came down to the normal stars surrounding it, ( which in New Hampshire in a dark part of town can be pretty spectacular for a boy growing up in the subburbs of chicago for most of his life!). At that moment the star, or what it at fist appeard to be, gradually sped strait up into the atmosphere. In other words, It ascended rapidly, but not to fast, into the sky as if saying, \" time to go!\" This is the second sighting I have wittnesed in this area. The first being a blue star sitting amongst the rest, and the speeding up into the atmosphere at an unimaginable rate of speed. I am convinced that these craft I have seen are not of this earth and are being shown to me for a reason.

The light was stopped very close to the ground and we thought that it was a law enforcement helicopter searching for something. We walked up to the back porch thinking that there might be a criminal in the area, and stood by the door. As we watched, the light then moved towards our house and was out of my view (we were standing on the bottom deck). Once it reached the house, it came back into view. It sounded like a helicopter and my mom said that she heard it from inside her bed room. I never saw the actual shape due to the intensity of the spotlight, but when it came up to the house, we could clearly see the bottom of the object. It was round and with a few white lights on the bottom. It appeared to be a white, or light grey color. It flew over the house very slowly so that we had a good thirty seconds to see the bottom of it. It was a very strange looking helicopter, if that's what it was. The spotlight was very intense. It lit the pool area as it flew by. I'm normally very skeptic of U.F.O. sightings, and am not confinced that it was one, but would like to find something to explain this object. It was extremely low, sounded like a helicopter, shaped like an aircraft or circle from underneath, and had a few lights including a very bright spotlight.",

It was a very clear sky without moonlight so the stars were very visible.  Took dog for a walk in a large field and took the opportunity to stargaze. Immediately noticed movement low on the Northern horizon.  Braced myself against a fence to make sure the two lights were in fact moving.  I estimate a low flying object no more than 1000 feet altitude and 200 feet in diameter (large).  The trailing light was at about 35 degrees lower than the leading light and this attitude and orientation was constant.  Both lights were white and steady and I could make out a very light white or light blue light arc of light or forward rim on the leading edge, suggesting a saucer shape.  There was no sound and the movement was rather slow for an aircraft.  I counted 10 seconds and judged it at about a 1/2 mile... -180 mph.  At its closest it appeared to pass within a 1000 yards of me (a fence stood between me and a high school football field, so I had a decent basis of comparison).  At this closest point I had a horrible few seconds during which it appeared to stop moving forward and seemed to be getting either bigger or closer.   It did however, slowly proceed northeast without a sound.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 more minutes before it was gone, low on the northeast horizon past Palatine and towards Mt. Prospect. Interestingly, I realized I was hearing a \"wooshing\" of air shortly afterwards.  I saw no aircraft in the sky at all, but there was no mistaking the sound of a subsonic jet passing overhead, but not like any I had ever heard.  It sounded extremely low and \"muffled.\".  There were no chem-trails (I was looking for chem.-trails to appear from the first craft).  My watch read 3:05AM.  This too was followed by a distant, low rumble, which I presume to have been a high altitude supersonic aircraft, again unlike any I had ever heard and much more subtle than the ones I have heard.  Although I have no explanation for the first craft, I speculate that the last two craft were chase planes -one subsonic following closely and the other supersonic circling at a distance.  The sounds clearly occurred over to great an expanse of time to be physically connected to one another or the siting. This is the second siting of \"unknowns\" I have recently enjoyed while walking my dog.  I hate the idea that such phenomenon is commonplace above our suburban skies.  I expect to see other reports of this night's occurrence here.  It was the most remarkable thing I've ever seen and heard.",

Then one of the blue lights shot across the sky at an amazing speed, and at the same time the orange light fell straight down.

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Aura or haze around object, Emitted other objects, Changed ColoLarge hazy amber orb with two bright greenish-blue orbs circling object wildly.\n\r\nMy wife and I and at least 50 witnesses were out at Long Lake Recreational Area outside near the north end of Long Lake (located east of Fond du Lac County). At approximately 10:05 p.m., a series of very unusual events began occurring and continued late into the early morning hours. At 10:05 p.m., we were looking south and could plainly see the planet Mars off the southern horizon. Slightly east of this location, a large bright amber colored light rose straight up from behind a forest of trees in the distance. The object went up approximately 25 degrees off the horizon and moved in a northerly direction at about the speed of a fast moving airplane. As it was removing, it seemed to drop round orbs of amber colored lights. It continued and disappeared in the northern horizon. As it disappeared, a second object reappeared exactly as before and followed the exact path as the first object. This object also headed north and seemed to stop before the northern horizon. At this point, a third object rose again at the same exact starting point as the other two. It rose up and became extremely bright white and accelerated in a northerly direction in the same path as the previous two. Along its path several times, it seemed to flare up bright and dim and several times it seemed to drop amber balls of light. As it approached close to the second light, the second light blinked out and the third light continued northerly and finally blinked out. This series of events started at 10:05 to 10:20 pm. At this point, everything seemed to calm down. At this point, we were excited but some of us felt these 3 events could perhaps be described as airplanes or pyrotechnic devices, therefore, no one seemed to draw irrational conclusions. This was only the beginning of several strange events that were to follow. At approximately 10:35 pm, a 4th amber ball of light rose from the general location as the previous three. At this time, the fourth light however headed westerly instead of northerly and seemed to hover approximately 30 degrees off the southern horizon and was blocked by trees approximately the first 20 degrees. Now the object after it headed west seemed to head north directly toward us and became quite large, approximately the size of a small finger fingernail at arm's length. At this time, became extremely white bright and then extradionary the orange's object seemed to have a definite halo or fog around it. Outside of this halo were two distinct bright greenish-blue tiny orbs that continued to circle and rotate wildly around the object. At times, the two greenish-blue orbs would seem to stop directly in front of the object and at times, they would stop and change direction wildly. Other times, they would circle around the top or bottom or around the side of it. This wild movement continued for approximately 35 minutes and was seen by at least 50 witnesses, some had video cameras and still cameras. After approximately 35 minutes, a major event occurred. At this time, the large amber object seemed to split into two. One piece shot directly down towards the ground and was covered by the trees. The second piece seemed to disappear. At this time, one of the intense greenish blue orbs \"shot\" directly up and northward at an extremely high rate of speed covering the sky from where it had been to the northern horizon in perhaps 8 seconds. The other greenish-blue orb continued to stay in the general area above where the amber orb seemed to have descended or crashed to earth. The time now was approximately 11:15 pm. The one remaining greenish-blue orb continued to move wildly up and down, side to side doing circles and loops but stayed in the general close area. The single orb continued to move wildly into the early morning hours. Unfortunately, I left for home approximately 12 midnight and drove home. Several friends of mine stayed until 1:30 am and the object was still there and doing its wild dance. I don't know how long this continued because most people left near or at this time. During all these events, I had a 35mm camera equipped with a 450 mm lens mounted on a heavy duty tripod and was using 1600 ISO rated color print film. While looking through the view finder and centering the object in the microprism, I could clearly see the object move wildly and I know my camera wasn't moving nor was I. I shot approximately 30 shots of film during both major events, the first three and the fourth. Also, I used a 10x50 BAK4 optics glass binoculars meant for astromonical use and viewed the object. Clearly, I could see what appeared to be an envelope of haze or fog that surrounded the amber light. The two greenish-blue lights appeared clearly and extremely bright and very distinct with no haze whatsoever surrounding them. The greenish-blue orbs reminded me of what appeared to be bees flying around the object in a nonrestrictive orbit, changing directions and paths many times.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Several reports.

At about 10:35 pm, I spotted a large orange sphere on the south end of the lake heading north-northwest. The orange sphere had a hazy glow around it. There were also two bright greenish spheres moving wildy around the orange sphere. Note, I could see this clearly without optical aid. When I used my husband's binoculars, each bright greenish spheres looked like tiny v- shaped objects when they appeared in front of the orange sphere. When the bright greenish objects moved wildly on the sides and top of the orange sphere, they appeared to be spherical. I continued to watch with and without binoculars. There was a bright flash and the orange sphere split into 2. The bottom half appeared to have dropped to the ground and the top half disappeared. One green sphere headed to the north at a fast rate of speed and the other green sphere stayed in the general vicinity of where the orange sphere had been and seemed to move wildly around that area. I continued to watch the green sphere until 11:15 pm. The mosquitos were getting too bad for me so I went to the car. My husband stayed to watch it for a longer period of time.",

She says it couldn't have been a shooting star (because I wouldn't be able to see such a small faint light through a window with lights on in the house), and it couldn't have been an airplane (unless it was completely engulfed in flames and burning so hot that they were blue flames).  So what else could it be?  It is definitely an Unidentified Flying Object.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Both were identical in shape and in color: Something like an oval with triangular wings, but not like any jet or plane silouette I've ever seen. What was really bizarre was the color was a coppery-gray and the whole craft shimmered in appearance, as though we were watching through a hot exhaust. Both planes moved in tandem, and the second weaved gently around the first, moving back and forth from four-o'clock to one-o'clock (relative to the first). The overall movement of both craft was steady, swift and silent. My wife and I and a friend saw the craft initially, and as we alerted other friends inside, others came out and saw the craft shortly before we lost sight of it. Also: my wife and I were just reading other sightings, and the description of the craft reported in Bangalore India sounds exactly like this one, except that we couldn't see enough detail of the crafts, and we think it didn't fade away.",

There were no other lights surrounding the object; there were CLEARLY no standard regulation aircraft beacons, strobes, or wingtip red/green lights, and the object made no discernable sound. If an aircraft, it was certainly not an ordinary one. OBJECT 2: Approx 1 minute after disappearance of object 1, same type amber light appeared in same location and began same northward track. Approximately thirty seconds after appearing, object flashed very brightly white -- looking similar to a very bright set of aircraft landing ligts -- approximately a half dozen times in rapid succession -- then continued on same original course. When object was to our east-northeast, a tiny deep red point of light appeared below the object and proceeded downward to disappear in the treetops below. Some comments were that it looked like someone dropping a flare. OBJECT 3:  After object 2 had \"dropped its flare\" and was tracking off  to the northeast, another amber light of the same type appeared in the north. It too performed the same flashing of bright white lights. And, it also \"dropped flares\" -- three times -- before disappearing in the southeast. OBJECT 4: Four to five minutes after the disappearance of object 3, as the crowd was abuzz with discussion of that we had seen, one more amber light -- this one somewhat dimmer that the first three -- appeared in the south-southwest. This one had an additional feature the others had lacked; two  blue-green pinpoint lights which appeared to be circling the amber light. The entire complex slowly tracked westward toward the tree line, while seeming to bounce and weave in an unpredictable manner. The complex eventually disappeared into the trees, then reappeared on other side of trees several minutes later, still bouncing and weaving. This persisted for several more minutes until a muffled \"popping\" sound was heard, the amber light disappeared, another deep red point light dropped toward the ground, and one of the blue-green point lights rapidly accelerated off to the northwest and disappeared. The remaining blue-green point light remained in the same general location, bouncing and weaving back and forth within the space of a few degrees of arc, for another 90 minutes or so, at which time the reporter departed the scene for the evening. notes: This was reporter's first ever personal sighting of a UFO.

The amphitheatre had a grass field we all sat on, with a stage at the bottom of the slope, where a screen was set up for the lasers.  Finally the show started and within 3 minutes, all the lasers quit.  The crowd booed and complained, and a voice on the PA said the usual apologies along with Technical difficulties excuse.  I went back to watching the stars while the crowd pissed and moaned.  Suddenly I noticed a spot in the sky that was darker than the sky itself.  At first I thought a bunch of balloons were floating slowly by, but I then noticed, it was a triangular shape, with a \"Y\" shape, along with many barely visible curving light traces, almost like black light neon.  I had time to say, \"what's that?\" and point, whereupon my wife looked and exclaimed, \"What the heck IS that?\" and then it just dissapeared.  It was like it Melted out of sight.  It did NOT zoom off.  It just dissapeared as it slowly drifted over the edge of the ampitheatre.  No one else immediately around me said they saw it, and as everyone started looking at us funny, we dropped it. However, the lasers never did come back up, and we drove home nervously looking at the sky.  I only told 2 close friends about this until I found your website tonight.  I do NOT know if the failure of the lasers was related to the sighting, but it sure was weird none the less.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

It was at night, around 9:30 pm, and I was driving me and my boyfriend to a Bowling Alley in the neighboring town of Wyandotte.There were railroad tracks we had to cross, but a train was on the track, so I waited there in the distance for the train to end. My car was parked perpendicular to the train,normally,the cars would be facing the train, but since I saw it coming before I reached the tracks,I just stopped at the  street corner before the tracks.There was an empty field directly across from me, so I could watch the train go by over my left shoulder. We each commented on how long this train was.Then suddenly we saw 3 bright white lights following the train in the same direction as it was heading.We thought they were helicopters,but quick movements and darting about made us suspicion they were something else.It was as if these \"lights\" were playing a game of chicken with the train. We watched in awe when just as suddenly, 2 of the lights sharply turned upwards at a right angle and disappeared in a matter of seconds.Then only one light was left, which continued to follow above the train, turn, then loop back and forth.This last \"light\" was flying much lower now, and we could see that it was not a helicopter.Imagine our shock, when this \"light\" seemed to discover my car, all alone, waiting by the roadside.It stopped following the train, and promptly flew over to the field which my car was facing.It was hovering so low, we were able to get a perfect look at the \"light\", which wasn't just a light, but a triangular shaped craft,dull silver in color.It sat in the air silently as we stared in amazement. None of the weeds in the field even moved.It was silent and almost perfectly flat.We were frantically searching for an engine, a cockpit window, or anything that would make sense and make it recognizable, but nothing could be found.Whatever was piloting this craft could not be seen.In front, which was facing us, was the bright white light we had seen chasing the train.On the other 2 points of the triangle,there were red lights,as if tailights on a car.This is where my sighting gets unusual.My boyfriend suggested I flash my headlights at this craft.Being directly across from me and approximately<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

Well, I too have seen this object many times traveling on the Nashville Road going to or from Franklin, Kentucky.  This object(s) does not appear every night-just at various times.  I cannot explain what we (my friends and I, and others) are seeing, but it IS real.  Most of the time the object(s) seem to be to my left as I am driving toward Franklin, Kentucky.  The object glows really bright with a red light sometimes appearing at the bottom or center of it.  Then, all of a sudden the light will go out.  At times the light wil zig-zag for a time.  \n\r\nOne night as I was going home from Church, I looked up and there it was, glowing like fire on a very dark night.  The object then began to move at a very slow pace and was getting nearer to my automobile.  I was a little concerned to say the least.  Then I looked underneath this object and saw 2 more smaller lights flying faster underneath it.  They were very visable.  \n\r\nAs I approached Bowling Green, the fireball light was still there.  As I got closer to the light the object seemed to take on a triangular appearance.  I cannot be sure because the trees were obscuring my view, but it appeared that something was there.  \n\r\nI must mention that one time previously at my friend's house we saw the object, and we took out his binoculars to take a look at it.  The object looked rectangular or diamond shaped, and had a purple glow to it.  There could be a reasonable explaination for this-but I don't know what it could be.  \n\r\nAs I said before, on various nights this glowing fireball can be seen clearly, and it seems to big to be a glowing star. \n\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I had identified several planets and constellations to my friend when I noticed a very fient triangular object in the southern sky.It really looked like dim stars on each point of a triangle and it was moving upward,very slowly.It stopped,then moved left,then up and out into space until I could no longer see it. It disappeared at my 1 o'clock position as I faced south.I pointed it out to my friend as soon as I saw it and he confirmed that I was not crazy or seeing things. It was very fient and very large.

The craft was directly over the woods next to my house, so as we were coming down our driveway, we both had a very good view of it.

When i came in my house, i stood at the kitchen window, and we could both see the lights coming over the treetops, and i waited for about ten minutes, because i knew that if it was a plane, then it would fly over, but after ten minutes, the lights didn't even seem to move, my neighbors might have seen this also, but i am 100% sure that we saw a ufo last night.

Then suddenly a pinpoint white light streaked across the span of the door so fast that it shocked me. It must have taken in my guess a fifth of a second or less to cross. I live way out in the country and frequently see falling stars, but I have never seen one travel this fast. I don't guess that anyone else could have seen it, but I thought I'd pass it along just the same.",

I write it as a story of the events that happen. I have no answers to why me? You all can call me I cannot run from this any more. Visitors on A Cold Night Sometime last year I received a visit from two strangers. As the year passed, I have not heard from these strange visitors. One day out of nowhere they came in the earlier morning to see me. This day was very cold. They came from a far away place that was not known to us. One day during the week it was very cold. The wind was blowing very hard so my home was cold. The heaters did not do their job very well. As the night fell our trailer was getting colder. My family and I had blankets over them to stay warm. We all sat next to the heater as the wind and cold came through the trailer, so the evening was very cold. Bedtime came and I put my boys, Bdeleted)) and Jdeleted)) to bed. Even, though their room was cold their heater did the job, as it was suppose to. B and J fell asleep. My husband deleted)) and I went back to the living room to sit down and have some cocoa to warm our cold bodies. Then we went back to watching TV for the rest of the night. As time went by we became aware it was 10:00 p.m., the news came on. Even though it was very cold in our trailer, we still enjoyed each other's company. After the news I decided to get up and go to bed. It took a few minutes to get settled down for a good night sleep. I do remember laying my head down on my pillow for a few minutes. I do not remember anything until 1:30 a.m. in the early morning. I do recall waking up for a glass of water and going to use the restroom. Then I returned to bed and fell back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard this sound that woke me up out of a sound sleep. This sound was so far away as it traveled in a downward, vertical descent from the sky. This sound was nothing like a plane engine. The noise had been getting louder and louder as I had been lying in bed shaking from the fear of what was going to happen to me. I could not even move out of my bed to get my family up so they could hear what I was hearing. This shaking and terror that my body was feeling is something no matter what I say will never allow a person to understand what it felt like to be so afraid that your body can not even move to get help. The time was 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I first heard this noise. I tried everything to move; no matter how hard I tried I began to shake worse from the terror that I was hearing coming down toward me. My fear had been so strong that I could not protect my family and I tried to hide like a scared cat running away from what I could not see. Suddenly, I turned and looked at my clock, which said 2:30 a.m. The visitors were in my room holding on to my shoulders one on each side. I do not even remember how I became very warm and standing straight up; I was moving, but my legs were not. It felt like I was leaving a house front door and going into a doorway with a bright white light. Both of these little people had long arms and big black eyes. They were shorter then me. Their heads were bigger then their body and came to my shoulder. I felt as though I was not in my trailer at all. I do not have a door where my bedroom windows are.  Even though I felt at peace with whatever happened to me, I still do not understand it all. I do not remember anything after I went to the light. When I was returned to my room on my bed, I was shaking from fear again from the sound as this noise was now leaving straight up into the sky. I turned my head to the clock and it said 4:30 a.m. After the noise left, I calmed down; it took me a little while to stop shaking. I finally got up to go through the doorway to get my husband. Suddenly, there were smells in my room that I could not tell where they came from. They were very strong in odor. Then in just a few minutes the smell was gone. I still to this day do not know what happened. I was awake. I am one who will always find a way to protect my family, but this time I could not protect anyone, not even myself.

As I drove east on Hatcher Road to my home on 19th Street (last street on the mountain) I saw a bright object that looked somewhat like a Goodyear blimp, but it was covered with lights...multi-colored lights.   And it seemed to be traveling at a faster speed than a blimp.  It was about 3 blocks away at about 200' in the air.  I thought it was going to land on the roof of my home, but it continued in a northeast direction across the mountain.  The area is in the Dreamy Draw area of northeast Phoenix.  I am 5a 56 year old grandmother of 12 and have never witnessed anything like this before.  I immediately called Phoenix Police Department to report what I had seen.  They directed me to call Sky Harbor Airport.  Sky Harbor said there were no blimps in the area and directed me to call UFO reportings at a 480 area code number.  I have been trying to find out all day what this could be.  I am curious.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Please see other reports for the same area for July 23rd and 24th.

It becomes most evident around 22:00 and lasts for approximately 2-3 hours.  The first night we saw this thing in the sky and stopped at a gas station to view it with about 3 other people,  after a 5 minute period we saw a red light come off the right part of the thing and fly very fast downwards then around the aircraft then disapear.  If you blinked you would have missed most of it.  We have video taped this and you can see the lights changing colors from red to blue to green.  It will go towards the ground then go back up almost as if it were a yo-yo.

Right as I passed the California/Arizona border I noticed what looked to be three glowing lights in the sky, just above the horizon.  I commented about them to my friend because unlike aircraft lights these were glowing an orange color, were much larger, and appeared to be motionless, like they were hanging there.  At that point they did not look like fireballs. I thought they could be tower lights but they were much too high, the wrong colors, and there were no towers around.  We passed behind some hills and lost site of them, and basically forgot about them. About fifteen minutes later we were in an open stretch of the desert when I saw the lights again streaking parallel to the highway but far off and very high.  Rather than lights I could see more clearly there were several huge white-orange fireballs streaking across the sky at high speed, just like meteors but seemingly much bigger.  They were so clear and vivid (no clouds, haze, fog) not to mention bizarre, we pulled off to the road to watch them.  Several would streak across the sky, then another couple more would come, then several more and so on all following the same \"path.\"  Again these fireballs were huge.  They streaked from east to west, directly to the glow from the city of Palm Springs (which was hidden behind a mountain).  What was especially memorable was that while some streaked by with meteor-like trails behind them, those already in the distance appeared to hang motionless in the sky (quite possibly because of our angle of vision). The fireballs did not appear to have a manufactured shape, like a saucer, have any visible manufactured elements such as lights, or move in a controlled fashion across multiple planes; they simply streaked. Then it suddenly occurred to me: this must be the Mir re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  I knew the station was supposed to come in over Argentina but no one knew exactly where it would go.  It looked just like a body entering earth's atmosphere and breaking up.  I did question some elements at the time though, because the fireballs seemed very large, much bigger then pieces from the Mir, but then again I don't know anything about the Mir.  The other question my friend and I discussed while watching this display was why it had been going on for a good 25+ minutes.  If the Mir came in I would expect it to be more or less one \"clump\" of little fireballs. In the distance, the exact direction the fireballs were traveling, they seemed to arc down toward the earth, like they were falling gradually.  Then there were large flashes where they appeared to fall.  Seeing the arcs and flashes (which looked like lightening in clouds far off in the distance) I thought the \"Mir\" was breaking up and hitting the earth, although the flashes seemed surprisingly large.  Although it sounds absurd now, I actually thought the LA area was being hit with \"debris.\" After the display ended we kept driving west.  I turned on the radio near Palm Springs only to hear that at the Mir re-entry was not due for another 45 minutes and indeed it was coming in over Argentina.",

It did not move it just hovered there for hours, Gradually getting higher in they sky as the sun rose. I stood under it and so did my kids and neighbor. It didn't make any sound. It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seenit but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something.

I will number my descriptions 1 through 8; the intervals are approximately 30 seconds.  Conditions were very clear, without haze or a cloud layer.  Mars rising in East and stars emerging brightly at 9:15 pm. Viewing to the SE from 2nd floor balcony w/trees in foreground. My brother saw everythig after point #1, we called his girlfriend to witness from point #4. We discussed this description. 1) Orange light rising.  Steady, not blinking.  Oval shaped, long axis horizontal. 2) Size growing.  Light's source seems shrouded by an accompanying cloud.  Slow rate of ascension give impression of approaching aircraft. 3) 1/4 circular arc of light appears in wake of main light.  Arc spans from 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock.  Arc is dimmer than main sorce and diffused. (Refers to Helicopter's search light) 4) Main light is surrounded by glowing field, more orange, which is brightest in the 4 to 7 position. A black arc appears between the bright source and the glowing field 5) A big change in appearance: a bright  yellow-white light with a comet like tail extending toward 2 o'clock. Tail extends width of fist at arm's length. By this point the object has risen from the horizon to about 30 degrees above, and and from SE to ESE. 6) The tail from the object widens to form a fan, it elongates, and dims.  The color of the tail or plume changed from dark yellow in #5 to a darker yellow orange now. 7) Changing again: now the object is a bright orange streak surrounded by a bright gray cloud. 8) At this point, after 4 to 5 minutes of observation, the image dims.  We see or hear no object leave the viewing area.  A very large, faint cloud lingers for 15 minutes in the in the deepening twilight.  A sketch sequence is available.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Our gratitude to this individual for submitting such a nice report.  Many other reports submitted for this apparent missile launch.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Aura or haze around objectWe saw this HUGE tringular craft with lights on each corner when I was 16, as it hoovered above us\n\r\nA freind and I were walking home from a school dance and just talking. I turned around just to see if any of our freinds might have been walking behind us. There weren't any. When I turned around I couldn't help noticing a huge triangular object in the sky kind of comming up behind us. I yelled at mt freind in awe and said something like \"LOOK\"! He said, what is it? I said something in the terms of, It's gotta be a UFO!! The object was \"huge\", atleast one hundred feet or more tip to tip. It made no sound what so ever and was fairly evenly lit by a bright light on each corner. It hoovered above us as we watch it for quite a while and we decided to leave. It went in the same direction as we did so we ran to get home. I lived near the spot where we saw it. My freind went home the long way to avoid the object. When I got home, my mother asked why I was home so late and I said I didn't know. About 10 minutes later, my brother came in the door. He was at his girlfreinds house up the street. He said look, we saw this earlier. He and his girlfreind were laying in her yard just watching the stars and whatever else and he said a huge triangular object went right over them. High in the sky, of course. He described the exact same thing that I saw and he had a picture that he drew and it was, the exact same thing I saw. It was in the news papers the very next day. A lot of other people saw it too. My freind never remembered the incident when I saw him a couple of weeks later. I had night mares for years of being in a totaly white room with no corners, and a dark object would come closer and closer to me towards my face and then I would wake up. I was stressed for a long time for some reason and for years I was convinced it was from seeing the craft. I had a small round scar on my left legg that I could never explain. It looks like a vaccination mark now. I had my throat checked once for a problem I was having. The doctor went through my nose with a scope to go down to see my throat. He asked me through the course of the check up what did I get opporated on for in my nose. I said I never got an opperation in my nose. He said you had to and I replied, I would know if I did. I had my nose courtorized when I was a child but never an opporation. That was the end of the conversation. I'm not saying I was abducted, but with all the things that happened to me, I sure thought about it. If I had the money, I'd get a whole body scan just to check it out. I would like to say that I and other people I know and talk to, beleive in u.f.o.'s. This is the reason I do. Also, about two years ago, I ran into! an old employer of mine at a store. We were looking for a good ufo movie and my old boss replied, I shouldn't tell you this, but I saw a u.f.o. years ago. Around 1970. He described the \"EXACT\" same thing we saw. And best of all, the same time frame. He lived behind the mountain where the school was located. He and his father saw the same one we did. Everything I mentioned here is 100% true. I'm 47 now and was 16 then, I recall everything I mentioned as if it happened last night. There is no forgetting. You can watch all the movies you want, but you just can't comprehend the feeling, of seeing something so large so quiet just floating in the sky abouve you, unless you saw it yourself.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

The craft was so black that if it turned off it's blinking strobe lights, you could not have seen it in the night sky; just its outline. The craft had three red lights at each tip of the triangle.  These red lights flashed independently of each other.  A very deep low rumbling sound was associated with the sighting. The craft was flying very, very slowly, as if searching for something. I cannot give an estimate on the size, however I would say that it was larger than a normal airplane. The sky was 100 clear with no clouds and about 2 nights into the new moon.

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectTwo solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the wind\n\r\nSeveral friends and I were taking a break from remodeling a newly-purchased duplex in northwest Denver, standing on the porch and chatting.  I am a sales professional and the other witnesses are business owners and real estate investors, all in our mid-thirties.  There had been some nearby thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, with sporadic sprinkles and a cool breeze.  At 7:20 the sky was partly cloudly, with more storm clouds beginning to develop and move in from the mountains.  As I was facing east, I noticed a tiny black dot in the sky about 20 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and appearing to move west very slowly.  I observed that it was not a bird, so I said to my friends, \"Look, there's a UFO\" and pointed.  I said it was probably a helicopter, but whatever it was, at this point it was a UFO, and my most skeptical friend said, \"Yes, exactly, it's an 'unidentified flying object,\" with a little laugh.  It \"drifted\" our direction much like a balloon would, and initially, that's what I judged it to be.  As it got closer to being overhead, I could see that it was actually not a balloon.  It was moving in a very deliberate fashion against the wind. The clouds were not moving fast by any means, but they were slowly drifting eastward, while this object moved steadily westward.  I grabbed some binoculars from inside and another of my friends had binoculars in her car, so she ran and grabbed them, and we watched as the object flew directly overhead.  Only two of us were incredibly interested in the sighting, so we looked at it through our binoculars.  I considered it to be football-shaped, and she thought it oval.  It was a dark reddish-brown colour -- very solid and not self-luminous.  But as it went over, we both saw a pinpoint light flash on the middle of the bottom surface a few times.  \"Did you see that flash?\" I yelled, still looking through the binoculars, and she said, \"Yes, I definitely saw a flash!\"  At that point, we both felt sure that this was not an explainable event.  We cou! ldnt' fi gure out, of all things, what would present itself like this.  Not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a blimp, but an apparent ovoid-type craft with a single light which flashed just a few times, which we could only see when it was overhead.  It still appeared to be \"floating\" like a balloon, without slowing or changing directions, but more with intention.  From the time I spotted it to the time it disappeared into the clouds to the west, it was probably close to 5 minutes, though we didn't keep track on a watch.  We both estimated the altitude of the object at between 1 to 2 miles, but it was hard to judge.  I figured it must have been about 20 to 30 feet in length and probably 2/3rds as wide, and it was traveling in the direction of it's longest length.  Again, the true size is hard to judge, but the apparent size was approximately one centimeter at an arm's length as it flew overhead.  When we lost sight of it, we both chatted excitedly about what we had seen for a few minutes, and then I spotted another apparently-identical craft directly south of our location, moving west.  It was on a trajectory about 20 degrees south of the first object, so it did not pass directly overhead as the first one did.  We lost sight of it within a minute as it flew right into a cloud, and never did catch this one through binoculars.  But it looked like the same type of object and it was moving at the same apparent speed as the first one, and in the same direction.  Once again, I looked at the clouds to confirm their movement, and they were driftly slowly eastward.  So whatever these UFOs were, they were deliberately flying westward at a steady rate of speed.",

It appeared to be a cyclic pattern, but once they were closer to being over head, there was the same pattern of movement over and over. It took only 30 seconds or so for the crafts (or whatever) to go from one horizon to the other. As they got further away, and closer to the opposite horizon, they took an immediate 90 degree turn, without slowing and rapidly sped out of viewable sight. My brother and I witnessed this. We could make out no \"craft\" only the lights. The odd part about this was that they were no more than 300 to 400 yards above us. Another interesting observatyion that my brother brought to light was the fact that there were no clouds in the sky before we noticed these objects. Upon reeling from what we had both just witnessed, we realized that there were now thick clouds on the original horizon, and fog was now moving in . Very wierd. I do not think that this is anything more han coincidence, but thought I would state the fact. Let me say for the record that I mearly beleive that the possibility for other life in the universe \"could\" exist. After that event, I beleive that it does. At least something does.",

While coming to the stop sign at the intersection of Meridian and McMillan I saw a Green light coming from the field northwest of the intersection. It was about 50 feet high in the air, moving parallel with McMillan about 40 feet north of the road.  It was coming towards me and then the Green light dissapated.  I could still tell their was an object flying in the sky and when it came to the point where it was going to cross meridian road, it banked and turned 180 degrees and was then heading west.  I was probably fifty yards from the craft.  Then, the belly of this diamond craft lit up like white lava and radiated very bright light on the ground.  As soon as the craft lit up, it dived for the ground and then pulled up back to about 50 feet from the ground.  Then the plasma light on the belly completely shut off.  I saw It then bank, and turn another 180 degrees and it was coming towards me again, still moving parallel with McMillan coming towards meridian road.  Then the Front of the craft illuminated it's front \"Head Lights.\"  It had three very large lights on the front of the craft.  The lights remind me of lights in a Football stadium.  The middle light was slightly higher then the other Lights on each side.  Then the Diamond shaped UFO started to radiate colors from the end of its wings.  Not blinking lights like an airplane, But slowly appearing light that gradually became brighter in color.  I beleive the first color was blue, then red then green.  It took about 5-7 seconds for each color to come on very dim, gradually become brighter and then dim out-to start the next color.  After the green color on the edges of the UFO dimmed, the front headlights shut off, the UFO banked and turned again, the belly lit up and the CYCLE repeated itself.  Instantly I knew I had encountered it again.  Absolutely nobody was on the desolate farming roads except for me.  I had a sensation ! of an ov erwhelming feeling that I needed to leave the area ASAP.  The only logical thing I could think of doing was to drive where lots of people were, so I headed towards boise down McMillan street at a very fast pace. July 28 2000. While coming home from work at 1:20 in the morning on a late thursday night (Friday morning),  I saw the exact same UFO I had just described.  Except this was the first time I had ever encountered a UFO.  The exact coloring, shape, plasma bottom, three head lights and the cycles of going in circles  were all the same.  But, I didn't recognize it untill I pulled into my driveway at home.  It was probably 100 yards away from me and the three headlights (It was so bright, that Is all I could see)was coming straight for me.  I scrambled inside of my house, and paced back in forth in disbeleive of what it was.  I  kept seeing the craft fly about 30 feet high off of the ground on my street where my house resides.  I quickly woke my father up to tell hime about the flying crafts outside of our house.  He woke up and walked outside with me.  Nothing was their.  He went back to bed thinking I was insane.  About 20 minutes later I heard the distinct humming noise this diamond craft makes and I immediately went back to wake my father up.  We went outside again and the craft was farther off in the distance.  Within a minute or so the craft was in our back yard, doing the cycles and my dad was so scared, he ran in the house (of course I did too).  We peeked out of our windows and watched the craft for about an hour and a half, going back and forth inside and outside.  While watching the UFO, it did it's cycles in three spots within about a couple of miles.  The first cycle was right near our house.  Then the craft would fly about 2 miles southeast and do some cycles  there.  Then the UFO would go directly west and do more cycles and then come back to our house, (northeast) and continue its cycles.  Three different spots of continuous cycles and then repitition.  This lasted for nearly 2 hours..... The UFO was quiet large.  I would say it is bigger then an average size home, Especially the width.  For how big it was, It meandered through the air like a hang-glider.  For something that big to be flying 50-60 feet off of the ground and turning around and diving towards the ground, ruled out any logical explanation of what I think it could be.  I also realized that when I had come across the UFO for the second time, it was one day away from being exactly one year from when I saw the first one.  The only thing I can conclude, is that both experiences happend on the last thursday night (Early friday morning) of July 2000 and July 2001",

I had looked at the clock, because I was waiting for my wife to return from the airport.  I immediately noticed a red light, moving generally from west to east.  It was bright enough that I initially thought it was a low flying, small plane.  I thought it would turn, at some point and I would see a blue or white light.  When I did not, I continued to watch it move in the direction of my house.  Then, it slowed and seemed to make a very tight semi-circular turn, then stopped,and became motionless. At this point, I thought it must be a helicopter, but I continued to watch it.  It gradually became a smaller red light, like it was moving straight up.  Then it seemed to stop again.  It appeared to be slowly spinning now, because about every 20 seconds, it seemed to have a dark band, running vertically. I continued to watch it (by now about 15 minutes had elapsed), I saw what looked like a short burst of silvery threads below it (about 2 inches proportionately in the sky ).  At this point, it had the appearance of a red star, in the sky, vs the earlier appearance of a low flying plane.  It then slowly disappeared, as if it was moving straight up.  The sky was clear that night, with no small moving clouds, in the area. I have been thinking about what I saw, since that morning and decided to search the internet, for a place to report it.  I noticed 2 other reports, very similar to my own, so I now know that I was not alone, in viewing this object.  I am a affluent, professional, business man, rational, and not under the influence of drugs.  Once I foud your web site and read the other 2 sightings of the same object, I almost did not report it.  Then I decided I should, since one more description might help in determining what he obect was.",

The fireball lasted about 10 seconds while leaving a small trail of orange and a orange haze around it.  My friend noticed it about 5 seconds after I had.  It then changed just in to an extremely bright star looking craft and zigzagged and swerved for about another 30 seconds or so until it disappeared over the horizon.

It was a beautiful night with small clouds and patches of sky in between.  There was an oval of diffused white light which appeared to be coming from behind the clouds.  Only th outline or the rim of the object was illuminated. It seemed as if it were over New Jersey, but I could not see any beams of light coming up from the ground. I moved away from the door and windows to turn out the terrace lights--literally an instant--and when I looked again it was gone.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden I could see it again.  It appeared as if it switched the lights on and off and had been there all the time.  It had just not been illuminated which is why I could not see it.When the lights came on again, they started off a soft lavender color and then went to pink and possibly green.  Again very diffused soft colors.  Photographs I have seen of the aurora borealis came to mind.  But this light was stationery.  No movement  The first time this light turned off was 3:04 in the morning. I believe it turned off once or twice again. I believe that one time it turned off when a helicopter went down the Hudson River.  After the helicopter was out of sight three balls of light (one at each end of the oval and one in the middle) flew away from the central light and instantly disappeared. They flew faster then any plane  I have ever seen.  I believe this happened at least three times.  The closest visual analogy I could make is the huge craft that the scientists played the music for in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\"  As a matter of fact this object looked exactly the same.  My friend was sleeping soundly during this so I called WCBS and ABC (whose studios overlook the same  part of New Jersey as I do ). I wanted to see if anyone else had phoned in after seeing this.  The people at both numbers were polite but obviously didn't believe me.  At 3AM I'm sure that many of th! eir call s are from people who are far from sober.  My friend heard me on the phone and woke up.  I excitedly told him what had happened, but since there was nothing in the sky now he had difficulty understanding what I was talking about.  However, as we were watching the sky, I saw a faint light, then two.  Once I brought them to his attention, he could see them, but since he hadn't seen the entire object as I had, they didn't mean much to him.  As I noticed a third light appearing, they suddenly flew off whoosh into the skies behind us. That he saw.  He couldn't figure out any logical explanation either nor could I.  I am aware that people in Virginia and some of the other southeastern states had seen something which was described as a fireball in the week prior to my experience.  What I saw was nothing like a fireball.  It was almost as if someone were projecting a slide from \"Close Encounters\" onto the clouds. I am retired, although I am only 55 years old.  I was the president of a company which  manufactured women's clothing. The most unusual thing I have ever seen in the sky was what I believe was a fireball over the Pacific off Tahiti.  The reason it was described as a fireball was that it looked like a bright meteor travelling horizontally.  What I saw over New Jersey was not a natural phenomena.  It was perfectly shaped and would appear and disappear as if someone were flipping a switch. I am terribly interested in knowing if anyone else saw this that night.  There are millions of people in New York.  Granted few are looking at the sky at 3AM, but someone had to see this.  It was huge.  I would also like to know about other sightings of objects similar to this. In the space for number of craft seen, I answered four.  I decided on this figure because I saw one huge craft and no more than three others at any one time.  However because three craft flew off at least three times, I have no way of knowing if they were different craft each time.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Changed Color, Aircraft nearbyTwo UFO's and a jet in pursuit.\n\r\nI was out playing catch with my dad at dusk, when I noticed a bright object, nearly due south of my house, appear very near &amp; below the moon (within the diamater of the moon below the moon) in the sky.  In appearance, it looked like a meteor or light reflecting off of a missile or the fusilage of a shiny airliner. In this first object, there was a bright light at the front, and two smaller lights very close in a line behind (in reference to its direction of travel), which made it appear to be the tail of a meteor (but they did not change in relationship to the front light, so I've pretty much ruled that out). The lights were nearly the same color as the yellowish-red type of street light (high pressure sodium, I believe). There was no sound, nor was there a vapor trail. The object traveled in a mostly west &amp; slightly south direction. When the object reached approximately south-southwest of my house, the 3 lights appeared to move closer together, until you could only see 1 light. This 1 light appeared to grow *at least* 4 times brighter than the 3 lights combined. It stayed bright for a period of time, maybe 10-15 seconds, then it dimmed to the brightness of the original light (the one in front without the 2 behind). It continued to move in the same mostly west, slightly south, direction until it faded out of sight (presumably from going further away). Just before the first object faded out completely, my dad looked at the spot where it appeared, just below the moon, &amp; saw another object. This second object was *identical* in appearance &amp; motion, including having the 3 lights combine into one, grow bright, &amp; continue west until fading out of sight. At a similar interval (just before the second object faded completely), the third object appeared. It was sighted just above &amp; to the left of the moon &amp; traveled in exactly the same direction &amp; approximately the same speed as the first two objects (presumably it was in pursuit). This third object was quite obviously a plane, as vapor trails and wings were evident. However, the leading edge glowed in 3 places a *bright* red, approximately the same hue as a bright red car, or a fresh cherry. I assume the bright red in front, was a reflection of the now set sun. I am no expert in finding velocities of flying objects, but if all three were plane sized, I approximate their speed at around 5-600mph, &amp; an altitude of 30,000 to 45,000 feet. At no time did any of the objects change speed or direction of flight. My very first impression of these objects was that they were planes that had the setting sun's light reflecting off of them. But there were no vapor trails (except for the 3rd object), no strobe lights, no sound &amp; no wings or tail (except the 3rd object, where we could clearly see wings). A few moments later an airliner flew directly overhead &amp; it was very clear that this was an airplane, we could see the full length of the fusilage, the tail, both wings &amp; a vapor trail. But the first two objects are very puzzling to us; they definitely fit the under the category of Unidentified Flying Objects. If this description isn't detailed enough, or you would like me to make drawings of what I saw, I would be glad to answer any questions or send drawings if you contact me by phone, mail, or (preferably) e-mail.",

You could not see a shape to the craft but it did appear to have lights that changed colors from different greens to blues and purples.

As we were returning home, we were passing through this small town when I looked at the driver and he was staring straight ahead.  When I asked him if he was okay, he just looked at me with a terrifying gaze and said...do you see those lights?  I was in the front passenger seat and hadn't noticed them because of the color of the lights in his vehicle reflecting off the inside of the glass anyway.  To our left (south) through the trees we could see a grouping of lights (about 20) moving along with us at the same speed we were traveling, about 30 feet off the ground.  There is a mountain ridge also to our south, and the lights were below the ridgeline, between us and the ridge, and appeared to be about 300-500 yards away.  The lights were all blue and randomly scattered about the object.  The color could best be described as a cold electric blue.  They didn't flash or rotate.  We stopped the vehicle about a mile down the road and the object also stopped.  It span of the lights were about 100 feet and were about 20-30 feet high.  We could see the lights very well through the trees.  It just stayed there as we got out (and got a soda).  There was no sound.

When we came out the other side (the valley opens wider), the object burst out from behind the hill into the open and immediately flew over the south ridge.  We never saw it again.

I was in the passenger seat.  Myself, the driver and another passanger all saw the same thing.  We kept seeing this really bright light over the road several miles ahead.  It was in the middle of nowhere and at first we thought it was some kind of plane, or airport.  But then we kept seeing it going back and forth so we figured that it was an overpass and we were seeing trucks cross over.  But when we got closer we realized it was something else.  It was literally swooping right through the traffic -which was fairly heavy considering it was 3:32 am in the middle of nowhere.  It had 3 bright white lights and when it would swoop from east to west over the highway it would shine an incredible bright beam down onto the road and surrounding ground.  Then after it swooped through the traffic and rose again the beam and the 3 white lights would go off and it would turn to one red blinking light.  It was not blinking consistently the same.  The speed at which the red light was blinking was changing, sort of like Morse code and I wondered if it was some sort of pattern.  Then it would flip around and back to the starting point.  I've NEVER seen anything move like that.  It was truly bizarre.  It turned in all directions, end over end and side over side.  It was very graceful and smooth.  It didn't jump at all.  It kept repeating this pattern.  We passed under it and kept traveling south.  When we drove under it, it was very high up with the red blinking light and it was flipping back to the starting point again.  We watch it make several passes.  At least 10.  We continued to watch it until we were out of site.  We travel back through the area almost exactly 48 hours later, there was nothing there.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We presume the witness implies a date of July 27, 2001.

The object was cylinderical in shape and changed to oval as it moved.  We noticed a bright glowing orange/gold color not present in other aircraft in the viscinity at the time.  There were several aircraft in the area at the time, inbound to O'Hare from our west/southwest position, and outbound and heading west from Midway at our east position.  All jet aircraft in the area were a darker silouette, that the vehicle in question ( with landing lights, anti-collision lights and flying a specific pattern.)  The object did not appear to have any wings or tail stabilizer and at once I thought that it looked like the slender silouette of an MD-80.  But all at once it changed shape to oval and stopped!  Right there about 7,500 to 10,000 feet, appearing to watch the commercial traffic!  To add to the mystery, we noticed an eastbound twin-engine aircraft crusing at at least 35,000 feet and for a brief moment, the object blocked our view to to the contrail of the eastbound crusing aircraft.  An outbound 757 from Midway passed our position, and the object began to move again, northeast, same altitude.  In a matter of seconds it dissapeared.",

I had considerable experience as a Civil Defense plane spotter during WW2. As far as I know I was the youngest qualified observer registered. One starlit evening I drove to the University's golf coarse to get a view of the clear and beautiful star lit sky. I had a date and shortly upon arriving I witnessed this rainbow colored brightly shinning,apparent,star. I pointed to its location. We both were amazed when it took off at incredible speed and stopped instantly,then after briefly hovering headed in another directin eith right angle turns. This strange movement went back and forth but eventually headed in a North Eastern direction,where it suddenly disappeared, from its originall South Eastern point.We could not explain it. We concluded it was some government secret. Lockheed Research facility was locate 5 miles away. We thought it eminated from there. I did not believe in extra terrestrial activities at that time.I am not even certain that word was in use then.I did not give much thought to it until some years later, when I realized I witnessed an actual\"UFO\". The multicolored flashing circular strobe-like lights and movement eliminated any other possibility.I have not previously reported this experience but it is time. Now or never. I'm getting up there agewise.\n\n\n\r\n((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE))\n\r\nDear Peter,\r\n     Thank you for your prompt reply to my sighting. I was 22 yeas old at that time. Your first sighting followed a few months later. I enjoyed hearing that you were so young when it occurred for you. At the time of my experience I wrongly concluded that it would be announced in the next decade. No such luck and the Government is still keeping the lid on it. Perhaps the problem is they don't understand it themselves. \r\n     The object made an erratic arc in the sky from San Jose toward the San Francisco Bay Area. It seemed to scan back and forth over what is now Silicon Valley. I have thought about it a lot over the years.Recently, I imagined the UFO may have had a capacity for seeing the future and gathering our \r\nfuture technology with some time travel to the future. This is really off the wall but once you witness an event like this it defies all our known physical laws and anything may be possible.\n\r\nIt is always good to meet a Stanford man and especially one who has spearheaded this adventurous project. It takes a lot of courage to buck the skeptics and you have succeeded admirably.\n\r\nI hope we will meet. Should you visit the Bay Area please let me know.\n\r\nRegards,  ((name deleted))\n\r\nP.S. My visual location was standing very close to where they located the \r\nStanford SETI site. That is rather amusing I think.\n\r\n((END FOLLOW-UP<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

Then I looked back and the huge star had moved way over to the right,and that's when I stopped and said \"oh shit! Not again\".It was the exact same thing my girlfriend and I saw 8 years earlier.It was a big blob of light hovering and bobbing a bit above the horizon line with another smaller \"wingman\" looking light lower and to the left of it.They were both moving around a little in strange bobbing motions.Sometimes they would appear to get to get bigger and then shrink back.I watched for about a half hour before noticing 2 more in the same formation in another area and not so obvious to the eye.Then I started trying to search the entire sky.They appear to be yellowish and sometimes blueish in color and unlike the actual stars around them.Alltogether I counted 10 of them (all in pairs).8 years ago we saw one pair of these bobbing lights but that time they came right up instantly and we got a full on close up look at the craft and we were absolutely terrified.We thought we were going to be abducted for sure.It came right at us.It had to have seen us atop a dune next ! to the w ater.It turned a bit though and went over the water in front of us then cicled in toward the houses and floated completely silently at practically rooftop level over the town area then reappeared down the beach where it came from originally(it was cicling the area).So then it came back for another run staight at us again.We were back to clutching each going,\"Omigod, this is it!\".This time it took a left and floated out over the water and into the darkness.There was no more yellowish light in the distance after that.It was over.I'll never forget that.Definately the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.The actual craft looked like this:Basically a giant tic-tac,metallic in color with three \"windows\",two small ones on the ends and one big one in the middle.They had etremely bright light coming out of them.It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.On the front pointing down was like a headlight(oddly enough)and when it was flying low over the water the reflection from the light on the water showed that it was only about 100 ft. up(at the most).I thought for sure I'd be reading about in the local paper.Surely someone else was going to see it.It flew RIGHT OVER town at like rootop level at 10 o'clock at night.But nobody saw except us.Oh well.Last night when I saw the same far away lights I've decided to try and tell my story to whoever will listen.Thanks.",

The kicker is behind this group(distance unknown) was a single light (same color as the first group) chasing or trying to catch the first group, just as it passed overhead the rear craft did catch the first group and I thought it was going to rear end the 4 lights, but it suddenly veered off to the left and went past the 4 lights. Winds were calm and slight thin clouds, half moon was about 30 degrees to the west of the objects. Speed of these craft was faster than the comercial or military jets.I observed them from about 40 degrees off the southern horizon till they disappeared behind the trees from my house to the north, there is no power lines or anything to distract my vision.",

At approx. 2100 hours, I received a call from the Wing Security controller asking me to tune my radio to the base frequency.  I did and started listening to a series of events that began with a missile site losing power and a strike team being dispatched to the site only to see this saucer shaped device hovering over the site.  When the team was ordered to advance onto the site, the device backed away and power returned as soon as it was away from the site.  This happened in the southernmost flight area OF THE MISSILE COMPLEX.  tHE DEVICE BEGAN A SLOW NORTHERLY ROUTE, TRACKING OVER MISSILE SITES AS IT WENT.  eACH TIME IT WOULD CROSS A SITE, THE POWER WOULD BE LOST AND RETURN SAS SOON AS IT PASSED AWAY.  tHE DEVICE CAME NEARLY OVER THE BASE AND WAS VISUALLY SIGHTED BY THE WEATHER OBSERVERS AND CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL.  iT CONTINUED NORTH OUT OF THE WING AREA WITHOUT INCIDENT EXCEPT FOR THE POWER OUTAGES. I turned all information into the AF Project Blue Book and never heard of the situation again.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have attempted to telephone this witness, in order to obtain more details, but have been unsuccessful in reaching him, to date.

The thing was silent moving south to north northwest  at an extremely high rate of speed, it covered the entire sky from horizon to horizon in 10 seconds. I am wanting to know if their have been any other sightings? I would also like to know if maybe it was some kind of anomally because it appeared to possibly be a reflection of the moon like maybe on the upper atmosphere!!!!!!!!! Please reply!!! Thank You.",

It had a white light on each tip (3 of them), and a really bright red light in the middle.  The object was moving so fast that I had a hard time following it.  Then it just stopped, without slowing down.  As I turned onto my road, It was hovering over this house.  I was trying to get home as quick as possible so my family can see it. I got to my driveway and it shot across the sky again, as silent as can be.  There was NO sound coming from this object.  It went so fast it seemed like it didn't move.  Then it just hovered over my neighbor's field.  Where I live, the neighbor's have about 5-20acres if land and woods in the background.  But, It just sat in the sky, for about 4 minutes.  It didn't bob up and down or move in the slightest bit.  I ran inside to get my video camera (but the battery was dead), I went back outside and it was still there, over the field.  Then it was gone.  I have never seen ANYTHING go as fast as this object did.  And then come to a dead stop.  It was amazing!\n\n\n\r\nsmooth, rounded, silent, triangular object  following me...\n\r\n11:50pm- I was driving home (southeast) on rt ((highway deleted; rural area)) in Ohio.  When I looked to my right (southeast) and there was an object.  Triangular in shape, the tips of it were very smooth and round.  There was a white light in each corner and a bright red light in the middle.  It hovered there for about 30 seconds.  As I came closer it shot over to the left (North).  The object was at a complete dead stop and it went so fast.  It didn't start slow or slow down to stop.  It stopped as fast as it went. It just sat there in the sky perfectly quiet.  It didn't bob up and down or anything, completely still.  It stayed there for about 1 1/2 minutes.  I turned onto my street (north).  I couldn't see anything for about 1 minute because there were trees.  When I did, it was at the beginning of my street, the south tip.  It was hovering over a house there.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home.  When I got to my driveway I couldn't see it anymore until it shot across the sky so fast.  I couldn't believe my eyes it went so fast.  I had never seen an aircraft go so fast and be completely silent.  It went over my house and went two houses down from mine (north) and hovered in my neighbor's backyard which is about 20 acres.  It wasn't very far from their house though.  It again just sat there in the air with no movement or sound, like it was watching me.  I sat in my car for about 2 minutes and watched it.  I was stunned.  I ran in my house to find my video camera but I had forgotten to recharge the battery.  So I was in my house for about a minute or two and ran back outside and it was still there. In my neighbor's backyard.  We had looked at each other for about 50-60 seconds and it was gone.  So smooth and graceful.  It never changed altitude, shape, anything.  It is hard to describe the size of it b/c I don't know exactly how high it was but it was larger than a full moon.  To guessimate, it wasn't very high.  I have a map of my town that will hopefully help you better on the location and direction.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have spoken with this witness at length via telephone on several occasions, and she is an excellent and credible witness.

I cought it early on and Couldn't make my mind up what it was, I was almost suggesting to myself that it could be a satellite due to the way it wasn't getting brighter, when it did just that. Slowly it started to fizzle like a firework, then it grew in size getting brighter all the time and seemingly sparking, then I saw a puff of green and then it all turned a really bright burning green. I past a few trees but could still make it out it was so bright, then I came out on the other side (I was looking pretty nuch North now) and the fire stopped and just this red glow continued for a second, then it was gone. But I do suspect there is a hole in the ground a few miles north from here. The object didnt break up.

The lights and the swath were moving accross the sky under the Milky Way, and they retained their relative positions to each other. That is, the lights lined up in the direction of travel, and the swath out in front not quite in line with the lights, and not touching the lights.  Also, as to the quality of the lights, one of we who saw it noticed that they did not flicker as stars do, but were brighter and had a steady light.  As to the swath, it was three or more times longer than the space between the lights and maybe a third the lights space apart in width.  The slightly uneven shape of the swath did not change in shape or quality, and the whole unit, which had no apparrent body besides the lights themselves, moved steadily toward the horrizon.  From midheaven to horizon I estimate about three minutes. It was seen by two parties of two on the island(Madaline) at that time and by young campers two hours away near Manitowish Waters, though the campers reports are less specific and are second hand as told to their captain.

I was at 5500 feet msl traveling at 115 kias.  The weather was clear and the wind less than 10 knots.\n\r\nAbout 10 miles west of Syracuse I noticed an object off my left wing.  It was keeping pace with me about 100 feet off the wing.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other wih the two plates being seperated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt bule lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall. the ufo was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  The skin of the ufo was a metalic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.\n\r\n At first I thought that is was from Griffiss air force base just north and slightly east of my path of travel. When I called Syracuse airport (the controling agency in that piece of sky) they were showing no traffic near me.  The Ufo then moved directly ahead of me and still kept pace with me.  There was no wake turbulance from the ufo.  \n\r\nI turned off all of my external and internal lights even my instrument panel and radio lights in case it was just some sort of wierd refelection.

They were in a triangular shape, appearing to be one unit.  There was only darkness between these lights.  We could not determine an actual craft, but it was definitely one unit.  The craft was above the treeline when I spotted it, my friend tried to keep track of the craft (I was driving).  It was on the left of us when we first saw it, then crossed to the right after we passed it.  It seemed to be \"hovering\".  At this point we lost sight of the craft.  We continued maybe 2 miles down the road and again the craft was in front of us.  At this time it was hovering above a field facing us.  I slowed the car almost to a stop, my window was partially down and absolutely no sound could be heard.  At the urging of my friend, I continued down the road.  (we were almost in town at this point)  When my friend turned around to see where the craft had gone, it had disappeared.  This was a trully strange event.

It is hard to describe the size of it b/c I don't know exactly how high it was but it was larger than a full moon.  To guessimate, it wasn't very high.  I have a map of my town that will hopefully help you better on the location and direction.",

I was driving notrh(really slightly north-east) on Interstate 95, at exit 57 for Guilford, CT. I happened to look up as the approach to the exit was an upgrade, and I noticed activity in the sky.... several fast moving,cone-shaped objects sped in a northerly direction. These cone-shaped objects had a tail which was lighted...I can't recall a color, but it was a lighted trail. I also noticed in the same short period of time, after the 4 to 6 cones passed toward the north,I then saw 2 to 3 speeding in the southerly direction. The northely and southerly movement was separate... not at the same time, first to the north, then to the south. I did pull over to the roadside to have a better look, but unfortunately there was no more activity. I drove to my exit, # 58,and stopped at the ramp end and again looked skyward only to observe no further activity. As I drove home I tried to continue looking skyward while watching traffic. Nothing! When I reached home,I ran to the back yard to get a better view however, sadly,I saw nothing else. I did observe the Hale-Bop(sp?) Comet a few years ago and would say  these objects looked similar, but smaller and mover much faster through the sky. This activity all happened within 2-3 minutes...from 9:58 to 10:00PM. It was especially exciting as the sky was so incredibly clear. This is my first sighting of any unusual activity since the HB Comet.I am not an astromomer, but merely a constant observer who is fascinated with beautiful skys.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness.  She was careful to record the precise time and location of the sighting, as is evident from  her description above, we observe.

I thought I saw a small private plane in the distance approaching, so I turned up my camera and set it on bulb, hoping the passing plane and its lights would cause a streak on the film.... anyway, as the craft approached, it was evident that it was flying very low and very slow. When the damn thing passed me overhead... about 60 feet in the air, it wasn't a plane at all, but a rectangular craft about 20 feet wide and about 50 feet long with a series of lights on the bottom lit up in no particular pattern. By the time I arranged my camera it was out of range. I snapped pictures but nothing came out. The craft was totally silent. I contacted the Air Force in nearby Warner Robbins and the tower told me they had no activity on their radar at the time I reported it. I feel especially lucky to have seen not only this craft close up, but another when I was quite young.

They could have been windows but were too far distant to really confirm.  When I looked at them with just my normal eyesight they were very bright in the sky, and with the binnoculars I could distinquish the strands of lights on the side of the object.  They were quite a way's off in the distance but were very large.  They started moving towards the south west after about 15 minutes until they disappeared.

(It was a small light)  We all thought it was funny our friend would mistake an airplane for a firefly.   It caught our interest, and we all kept staring at the \"airplane\". It was blinking, more like pulsing,  a white light, and it was pretty dim, and there was no repetitious pattern to the pulsing, it was a completely random order.  It would blink a bit, then not blink for a few deconds, then blink a few times rapidly, and so forth, and something about it seemed odd to everyone there.  (Except one of us, who we later discovered was looking at a real airplane in the sky, and thought we were nuts. We realized he was looking way to the left of the object were staring at) I couldn't figure out if the object was moving or not, it seemed to remain motionless, but then i made the suggestion out loud to compare it to the tree level to see if it is moving right or left.  The trees were pretty far away, and there was an inch of sky between the object and the tree line from where we sat.  (You know what I mean)   So we all (except for the guy who wasn't looking in the right direction) were in agreement that it was moving to the right a bit.  But then it seemed like it was back where it had been.  We watched this thing for a few minutes, debating whether we were hallucinating or if was really was moving from side to side like this, but never the less something seemed very strange about it.  Then it obviously moved higher in the sky, before dropping back down and to the right in a very quick motion, so fast that it left a trail in our vision. It had moved about an inch to the right in the sky.  Then it was motionless again, while the three of us were all kinda freaking out and \"did you see that?\"  sorta stuff.  Then it sank below the trees, reappeared about 20 seconds later, just above the tree line, when it changed from a white light to a pulsing red light.  Then it sank back down and was gone.  It made no sounds.  The whole incident lasted 5 minutes.  It in the direction of north in the sky from were we were sitting.  Northeast slightly.\n\r\n((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:  \n\r\nI already submitted the report, but I left out the date and time, which is important I assume.  Also, it was a very clear night outside, and yes there were airplanes in the sky that night, one flying at the same time as the object we saw, this being the plane the 4th person was looking at, thinking it was the object we were all bugging about.  He made no suggestion that the plane he was staring at was acting in any strange way.))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous.  Pd",

Their white lights were blinking, each with its own frequency that differed slightly from the other two.  When compared to a plane, these three white lights were reported as being much much brighter and moving much faster.  They were also following a path that was not similar to the usual flight pattern of airplanes in the area.  The observer is usually a UFO skeptic who would rather not dwell on the subject, but he was slightly riled up and excited by this sighting.  He repeatedly made the comment that \"that definitely was not an airplane\" and also said, \"I know that was not a weather balloon.\"  It was clear from that reference that he was rethinking his thoughts on UFO's and aliens.  He also said that he had felt like he was being drawn outside to look for the lights after he lost sight of them.  Having known the observer for many years, I was surprised by his level of intrigue and fascination.

It was a clear night with a few clouds and a bright moon. No sound came from it as it drifted east. I thought it was a blimp as I watch the light pattern flick on and off... However, I saw the shape seem to shrink and wondered at this until I realized it was moving east away from me. It moved or \"shrank\" very quickly and then suddenly began a southern line of flight again within 2 or 3 seconds. I watched it move south until tress blocked my view. I can't say I saw a surface-but it did block the stars. In addition, the movement away from me was quick enough to cause grave doubt in my blimp theory.",

(Sightings of strange lights were seen over Boise about 2 weeks earlier and I had seen one of them over Ontario and had mentioned it to my wife).   When I got out of bed and quickly went outside she pointed them out to me.   There were Two very bright lights in the North East sky about 5-10 degrees off horizon.    If you were to hold out your hand, they would be spaced approximately one palm distance apart. They were brighter than any star around them or any type of planet.   They were bright like aircraft Taxi  lights.    I thought that because of the brightness, they might be aircraft however the lights never changed direction as would be expected. I was in the USAF for 6 years as a Avionics Specialist so I've seen hundreds of aircraft coming in for approach.  Within less than a minute or so I ruled them out as being aircraft coming in for a landing.  (There were no Airports in their direction anyway). Object (A) was Left of Object (B) and slightly lower over horizon.   It was dimber and yellow orange in color.  It was still much brighter than the stars. Object (B) was much brighter even than Object (A).  Its color would change from yellow to white.  Its intensity would also change.  I was looking at it though binoculars.  It seemed to pulse at irregular intervals.   This could also be seen with the naked eye. We stood outside and watched them for a half hour.  I took pictures of them with my camera on time elapsed exposure.   As time went by they were were not moving upwards as normal stars would be but they were moving South.   It was slow movement.   I could tell this because I was resting my camera on the roof of my parked car and the objects were creeping slowly  south torward a near bye neighbors tree and eventually into it. The neighbors tree is East of my location.   I called New Channel 7 in Boise and reported the sighting to them at approximately 0400. I also called a man at a nearbye prison who works in a Tower there.   He could also see the lights. My wife stayed up and watched the lights until the sun came up and then stopped observing them.    I went to bed at 0430. The next night on 04 Aug 2001 at 0400 my wife went out to check on the lights again and they weren't there. The third light was seen by my wife and disappeared as she was coming into the house to wake me. Sould the pictures turn out good, I will send them.",

It was unusually cold.  The wind was strong and from the NW, which is why we were walking backwards against it.  The location was roughly 100 yard west of a used-car lot (which is still there) and perhaps half a mile east of what was then Martini's diner.  The sky was bright with stars.  I don't rremember if the moon was visible.  A mile or two away, to our east, a line of treetops was outlined.  A brilliant silvery sphere rose slowly and deliberately up from behind the trees.  It was impossible to judge its size.  Relatively speaking it was about the size of a full moon.  Because the tree line was about one or two miles away, the sphere must have been of considerable real size.  It wobbled slowly upward and in our direction until it was almost directly overhead, then made an abrupt turn to its left.  By this time my friend and I had stopped walking and had begun waving and shouting at it.  It wobbled in the same falling-leaf motion until it disappeared over the horizon to the north.  All together it was in sight for about 9 minutes.  On its approach it covered an arc of about 80 degrees of sky, and about the same distance during its departure.  It was moving against a strong wind, was completely silent, and didn't change in shape, color, brightness or in any other respect except direction of flight, as far as we could tell.  Neither of us reported the incident.  It was not an ordinary object, not an airplane, balloon, blimp, space debris, satellite, or hoax --at least I can't imagine how such a hoax could have been perpetrated, or why, in the middle of the night in a deserted area.  It turned my conception of the physical world upside down.\n\n\n\r\n((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #1 FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nThanks for the prompt and flattering reply.  I'm grateful to finally have this sighting somewhere in the archives.  It's been bothering me for 48 years or so!  I was in high school at the time and didn't give\r\nit that much thought, but went on to become a skeptic, psychologist and trained observer.  It's made the burden of carrying this information that much heavier, since the experience matches up with nothing I've learned about the physical world or the mind.  As for my friend, ((name deleted) by name, I'm doubtful that I can find him.  It's been a long time.  I've heard that he spent a few years in prison and had become bald.   I'll see what I can do about contacting him.  If he's still alive I doubt that he's forgotten the incident.  I also know some others who have had sighting and will try to reach them as well.  Thanks again.\n\r\n((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #2 FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nMr. Davenport:  You can print whatever you like.  I don't know how much it adds to my credibility as a\r\nwitness in this instance but I have two doctorates, one in cultural anthropology and one in clinical\r\npsychology, which together would seem to cover a lot of bases where the exotic and the bizarre are\r\nconcerned.  Most of my career has been spent in research.  Of course ((name deleted))  name shouldn't be included.  (Just after this thing disappeared -- I don't want to call it an \"object\" -- he turned to me and said, \"Max, if you'd been alone and told me about this later I would have said right away that you were bullshitting me.\"  That's verbatim; this stuff is pretty clearly etched in my brain.)  I just did try to find him, actually, and located someone with his name living in New Jersey.  I sent him an email last night but have had no reply yet.  I'll let you know if anything else emerges.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  Also, witness indicates location of the sighting was in Deming, NM, but states it occurred in Keansburg, NJ.  We suspect the text of his report is accurate, so we have changed the location to New Jersey in the box filled out by the witness.  We have invited the witness to have the other witness submit a report, as well, if that is possible.  PD",

On Thursday Aug 2 2001 a Wausau WI-based radio station was flooded with between 550 and 650 phone calls from listeners who claimed to have seen a large green lite that would streak across the sky, hover, then appear to crash. Several people claimed to have also thought is was a plane crashing and so they reported the sighting to several police and sheriff's departments. PLEASE look at a map of WI: callers who reported this (remember: there were over 550 of them)were calling from Wausau WI, WI Rapids WI, Bowler WI, Nekoosa WI, Plover WI, Stevens Point WI,  in the middle of the state, all the way up to the northern part of the state: Minocqua WI, Phillips WI, Rhinelander, WI.  People reported having to stop in the middle of highways because this thing hovered 30 to 50 feet above the ground.  Police departments verified also seeing this, and also recieving the numerous phone calls reporting a so-called downed plane. Meteorologists have suggested the possibility that this could be ball lightening.  Ball lightening is one of the rarest natural phenomena, and if that's what this is, it seems strange that it was seen by that many people....How could something so rare travel from the middle of the state of wisconsin, basicly along highway 51, up to the northern part of the state? Does ball lightening hover over Dodge Durangos? The object was reported as being extremely huge, and VERY bright green. One woman said that as she looked at it through the small side window of her car (the one that is next to large window that you would actually roll down) the green glow filled the entire window. It was said to have a sort of red tail that could be seen as it was moving. Those who saw it hover closer to the ground said it was so bright, that it didn't appear to have any shape, except that looking into it, the center appeared black, surrounded by a blinding green glow, with evident lights at the bottom perimeter of it. It would move slowly, flicker, and stop, drop in altitude, then appear to either crash or land. People in several cities reported seeing it crash or land or disappear into trees in several towns....",

I could hear my friends talking as I stared up toward the sky, at my pole tip.  Suddenly, I noticed the stars moving, I thought! I started to recieve an adreniline rush from my heart, because what I thought was moving stars turned out to be a triangular shape silently moving across the sky towards New Jersey.  I froze staring at the the shape moving slowly, and I began to listen for my friends to say that they saw what I was looking at, but they didn't.  I said, \"Oh, (S)-word.!

It was a strange white, like the moon but was too far below the moon to have been confused with it. I drove a mile on Route 30 before I stopped at a cul de sac to observe. I got scared and continued on my way home. About 2-3 minutes on my way, I saw what seemed a large commercial, passenger airplane hovering noiseless about 100-200 feet above the trees, above a house. Both the unidentified object and the passenger airplane hovered as if set upon invisible pedestals, while the jet flying ovetr the u.f.o. was ascending quickly, either to investigate/attack the u.f.o, or to avoid its path. The passenger plane was close to me, nowhere near the u.f.o. The next day I noticed two small, private-like planes flying around and lots of chemtrails.",

Behind the crows, passed a 'dirty' white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was 'dirty' or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light's speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said \"What in the world is that\" Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as \"rapid\". I am 46, an ex-air defense artillery crewman [Vulcan] and have experience observing numerous aircraft types, in various light [reflective] conditions including military jets on afterburner or emitting IR decoy flares as well as satellites passing overhead. Light was not a short contrail. This was nothing like anything I have ever seen before.",

We were driving south on a road near an elementary school and a small neighborhood.  We first saw a ball of light hovering above the treelines.  It seemed to me like there was a car stuck in the top of a tree with it's brights on, as we were driving past it, I noticed that is was cirular.  It then ascended straight up, and appeared to be going southwest towards another neighborhood, I then sped up to about 60 miles per hour and watched it above more treelines.  Then it disappeared.  That whole part lasted only about 20 seconds.  We talked about what was just seen, and continued driving back to my house, about 2 miles away, as we approached the airport area, we noticed a lot of activity in the sky.  We counted approximately 9 helicopters, and about 7 smaller aircraft.  As we came to a stoplight we noticed a huge triangular craft, that seemed about 1,000 ( I know it had to be more) feet above my car, I went to get out of my car, but my friend stopped me.  We could see the underbelly of this craft, it was huge!  It had red, blue, and white lights, none of which were blinking and made no sort of sound... also the craft appeared somewhat shiny. It was just heading north in a very slow fashion.  My friend, who is in the Navy said it reminded him of a \"Super-sized Harrier jet, minus wings.\"  I have no idea what that means, but that is how he described it.  This aircraft continues North and did a 180 in the sky, just like that turned a half circle and headed south, then we lost sight of it.  we were about 6 miles from my house and were still counting other small aircraft in the sky.  Right as we turned into the main road that leads to my neighborhood entrance, we was another one of the triangle craft.  ( I am not sure if it was the same one, or a different one, if it was the same, it had somehow gotten to where we were without us seeing it)  This craft seemed to be much higher than the other one, and it circled my neighborhood.  It was still visib! le when we pulled into my garage.  I personally was terrified, and called the airport.  My friend went out back and tried to see if he could see anything through the trees.  He could not.  The lady at the airport was very frantic and hung up on me.  So I did nothing else about it.",

As it grew closer it appeared to be diamond shaped and an orange in color. It flew directly overhead and at its closest appeared to be about 1/2 the size, possibly 3/4 the disk of a full moon. There was a near full moon this night so I did try to make a rough comparison. I saw it pass in front of a bright star which confirmed to me that is was indeed a solid object and gave me a very immediate sense of depth that it was somewhat low in the sky but how far up it was I could not say for sure. It appeared to be luminescent in some fashion but illumination by the moon could not be ruled out as it was a very clear night out and the moon was bright enough to light up the lawn. Several people in the group described several small points of light, \"like the ends of a fiber optic cable\" said one friend (number varies between 6 and 7) offset but surrounding the diamond shape. I am slightly nearsighted with a -.5 prescription and unfortunately was without my glasses this night so I was not able to make out the surrounding lights personally but I very clearly saw the orange body of the object. As it passed overhead we heard absolutely no noise coming from the object. Minutes after the object disappeared from sight an airplane took off heading east over our heads from O'hare airport. The comparison to a low flying commercial airplane was easily dismissed as we observed blinking navlights on the wing-tips of the plane, take off lights and an audible engine noise. The observed craft had neither of these. As the craft receded from us a girl in the group grabbed her 35mm camera and attempted to photograph the object with her telephoto lens and managed to take two pictures of it. At this time it was pretty far away so we are not anticipating a detailed image. The group of witnesses of saw the object consisted of people between the ages of 24 and 30 working in fields from business to art. Some of the group are very admitted skeptics and others are believers in the UFO phenomenon but the group consensus from both sides of the fence was that no one had ever seen anything like it before and could offer no explanation other than possibly a blimp or a balloon. Before we got in to to much detailed description within the group I had two of the witnesses go inside the house and draw the object independently based on their own description. I personally am into astronomy as a hobby and have witnessed meteors and satellites many times to know exactly what they look like. I can identify all the visible planets as well as the star Sirius. I know it was neither of those.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an excellent observer and reporter of the facts surrounding the case.  PD",

Its course was parabolic and though its height was difficult to judge at night, it did not seem to be over six thousand feet up. It bore no resemblance to any aircraft, meteor or satelite that I had ever seen. I was on the porch of my house, which faces north, and looked up because I heard a strange muttering noise in the sky over the noise of the Saurday night traffic in West Houston. I yelled when I saw it and my daughter camr running out, but the object had already disappeared over the horizon,far faster than any helicopter could do it. The terrain is very flat down here and one can see quite a long way. My initial reaction was that it was a cruise missile, because it fit that profile.

There is very good fishing in these corries and thats what attracted us there.  We fished this particular one alot that summer and fall.  We were sitting on the bank not saying much.  Infact i remember just looking around me because its kind of an erie place.  theres alot of wild animals so i would always keep a watch out. my buddy was smoking a cigarette staring out over the lake.  I looked up and just above the lake there was triangle shape figure hovering motionless above the lake.  The object was only approximatly 3-400 yards away from us and maybe 100-120 yards above the water. The object was the most odd looking blueish color ive ever seen.  It was like a neon blue but it wasnt very bright.  I was so in aww of the object i remember looking at my buddy, he had this wierd look on his face like he couldnt believe what he was looking at.  I quickly looked back to the object.  I couldnt say a word.  The object hovered there for about 10 seconds, we didnt say a work.  Then very slowly it began to move.  It was heading toward the south side of the lake.  All of the sudden it began to increase speed very quickly and within a second or 2 it completely dissapeared.  We both looked at each other and said what in the hell was that?  We were both very frightend.  We imediatly decied to pack up out stuff and leave.  We were very skeptical to speak of the incident at work, because we knew people would laugh and think we were crazy, so we just told family and friends.  Another note, as the object darted away it moved so fast it left a trail of light that lasted maybe a second, but it looked weird. the object also made no noise at all it was completly silent.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

My girlfriend and I went out into the country to look at stars. We usually go about 15 miles outside of town so the lights don't interfere with our vision. I was looking up and noticed a small point of light. It wasn't extremely bright or anything, but as I watched it it moved in multiple directions. I have seen low orbit satelites before, but this was nothing like that. It would move up, then maybe to the left, stop, and then it would go down and to the right at a high rate of speed and acceleration. Sometimes it would stay perfectly still but then begin to move again. The patters of movement seemed to be random rather than the same thing over and over again. I would ask my girlfriend, \"What way is it moving now?\", and she would confirm the same direction that I had seen, without me telling her beforehand. I knew I wasn't crazy at that point. I don't know anything about UFO's, I never really even believed in them. I just figured, hey, we are only a small miniscule part of the entire world. So I would be self centered and nieve to believe that we are the only ones out there. If you have an explanation, please let me know. The only thing that I could come up with is that it was some sort of remote controlled satelite. But I think it was too high in the air for that. And why would a satelite make strange movements like that? Aren't satelites all going in the same direction in orbit? Do they have capabilities to change directions like that? Please respond to me if possible. My girlfriend is from Chicago but lives with me in Bloomington/Normal. We have made arrangements to pick up her dad's telescope the next time we visit them. I want to know more about what we saw. Please respond to me if you can. My e-mail is ((deleted)) or phone me at ((number deleted)) Thank you, ((name deleted))",

Watching, we realized it was coming closer at a fast pace. The headlights went out on our truck and the motor died. We got out of the truck and stood beside it watching as the light stopped directly south of us in a field. After awhile, the light 'winked' out. Windows, lit from within began rotating in a clockwise fashion. Some sort of huge object slowly 'swallowed' the lighted object from west to east, very dark and silent. The lighted object appeared again, the one we first saw. It took off at about a 45degree angle to the west,southwest at an encrediably fast speed till it was too far to track, just disappeared into a pinpoint somewhere up among the stars. Then a second light came in ,same direction, from the east, and stopped right where the first one did. It did not 'wink' out however, just sat there a few seconds, then shot off at that high rate of speed at about a 70 degree angle into the west, southwest sky as if in pursuit of the first one. Everything was absolutly silent the whole time. After all this was over, the lights worked on the truck again and it started right up.

At the time I was in the 5th grade and my sister was in first. We had spent all night driving up there in our Grandparents Gremlin (I think) one of those vehicles with the big hatch backs. We arrived in the middle of the night and our parents chose to leave us sleeping in the back rather than bring us in. I remember waking up to a very bright blinking light and waking my sister up to tell her I thought maybe Dad was outside swinging a lantern or something. I sat up to look and saw this huge light. It was shaped long and oval sort of like a saucer, hovering between  our two barns. It no longer blinked, but glowed like a giant light bulb. I immediately yelled for my sister to look. She becamed very frightened. We layed down and held on to each other until we woke up in the morning. We told out parents and our Mom told us how she had seen a bright light, but didn't think anything of it until know she realized the house is about 1/2 mile from the road with nothing behind it, but woods for miles. We defintely experienced something very UFO like that night and still wonder about it today.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

We were listening to the Beach Boys concert at a nearby park and at least fifteen airplanes crossed the sky as usual with the normal sound of jets accompanying them.  All of a sudden, a very bright light crossed the sky ten times the speed of any aircraft I have ever experienced, stopped in midair for five seconds, and shot off in a completely different direction.  I sat speechless for a few seconds.  My husband finally said, \"Did you see that?\"  and I said, \"I think we just saw a UFO.\"  He has been talking about it ever since.  I waited so long to post this in the hopes that someone else saw the same thing.  Like it or not, there is a stigma attatched to this type of phenomenon.

I was awake at this time because I was staring at the stars. Out here you can see all of the stars without the city lights interfering. From the west, I noticed a dark disk shaped object slowly moving and stopping as it made its way towards my location. I wasn't sure whether it was my eyes playing tricks on me until the object got within 50 feet of where I was. I was inside my sleeping bag next to my girlfriend which was asleep. I did not want to wake her in fear of her possibly scaring the craft away by getting up and screaming. I was frozen in fear and curiosity. I watched the craft slowly slip by, stopping for a few seconds at a time and continuing. There was a very slight hum amongst the silence around me. It was very eerie. At one moment, the craft emitted a dull blue beam from the far edge of disc as though it was searching for something. When this craft, which was now clearly visible as a shiny disc, came to a complete stop again, I crawled towards it hoping it didn't detect me. I kept thinking that this craft might have infrared or heat sensors to detect any movement outside, but there was no deviation from its course/task. At one point, the craft got to about 2 feet from the ground and the humming became louder. I got back without causing any notice when all of a sudden, the craft seemed to become enveloped by the surrounding area. It's as though it became invisible but with a slight atmospheric distortion. I watched this mirage-like phenominon float upwards until I could not see it anymore due to the darkness around. After about 5 minutes, the crickets started again and I stayed up until the sunrise anticipating the return of the object. This has changed my life forever and makes me realize that we might not be alone after all. I just wish that contact with another intelligent life form wouldn't be so uncommon or so hush-hush. I can handle the fact that there might be other humanoid ! lifeform s that we can associate with and learn from. Why should there be fear in contact? It's not like it's an alien inquisition or missionaries! They are scientists exploring without trying to interfere with our future. Something like Star Trek's prime directive of non interference. Besides, we have more to gain from them than they do from us. Maybe it is a form of mercy to our primitive minds that they don't make contact yet - or self preservation.",

I wlill therefore briefly explain the event please contact the filerfiles for the original report as this was a definate ufo sighting and i have photographs of the event. It lasted for at least 30 minutes while it hovered and manged to get about 4 or 5 photos weith a Canon 35 mm camera sporting a 200 mm zoom lens. it happened at  early A.M. i got up for a drink of water and noticed an extremely bright star blinking in the sky which caught my eye from my kitchen patio so i went onto the balcony to observe it and there it was, a diamond shape craft-star sitting in the sky hovering for over 30 minutes probably as long as an hour. It was brilliant white, flickered somewhat and with the naked eye colors could be seen either rotating around the top or alternating flash sequences....green and red. I of course then watched it with the 200 mm zoom lens and called for my fiance ( an ardent skeptic) and watched through the zoom lens. It had a red and green revoloving light on top or near the top it emitted a bluish beam at various times and even released another smaller diamond shaped light from the side which travelled away from it. Neighbours were also out watching because i could hear them talking aand wondering what it was and of course my flash going off at 1:30 a.m as i took photos attracted attention. it just sat there really high almost like a star for over 30 minutes. A commercial aircraft i think flew by at one point in the general vicinity, it didn't seem to veer off or even notice the object, i think it may have been too high. My fiance agrees with the following....it was not an aircraft helicopter or any other aircraft it was not a star it definately rotated colors red and green it emitted a blue beam and hovered in spot for an extende period of time. My fiance thinks it was the international space station but only because if it wasn't it doesn't leave much alternative. I know it wasn't, i've seen the space station in ythe sky from mexico and i watched this object with the zoom lens I will let you know how the ophotos turn out or contact me and i will send them to you. the film is not developped yet it was -is kodak max. 400 asa. again i filed a report within the next 2 days on filer files so you could always retrieve the original report. The weather by the way was clear with great visibility.

As I laid my head on my pillow, I noticed a light in the sky. I thought it was a bright star at first but as I kept looking I knew it wasn't a star.  So, I thought it must be an airplane. I then saw a red and green flashing light. I thought it was surely an airplane but it was not moving. It just stayed in the spot it was in when I first noticed it. I continued to lay in bed and look at the light, why, I don't know.  Suddenly it looked as if it were falling very fast and then stop instantly.  It did not fall a very long time but it was fast and then an abrupt stop. I felt a little funny inside when I saw that and got out of bed to look out my window closer.(It was 12:22 a.m. at this point) As I strained to look out my screen, the light seemed to by spinning and I could see flashing or spinning red, green, and gold/yellow lights. I looked aroud the clear sky and compared what I was looking at to the other \"stars\" in the sky. They did not look similar. The stars were plain and not moving and this light I was watching had color and movement. I just continued to watch because I wanted to see it move again.  It did move again and this time it was in an \"S\" movement up and then down again. Not too high or low just small movements within a certain area (I was looking between two tall trees and could see it the whole time)The movement is what kept me watching, it reminded me of playing video games and how fast and over exagerated we can move objects with the controllers. Then it  began moving toward the trees very slowly and sometimes with a little dip or two. I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. It was 12:50 a.m.",

I was driving an 18 wheeler across the Navada desert at around 24:00 hours. The moon was so bright I didn't need my headlights. I noticed some lights to my right moving my way. I watched the lights move toward me. I just thought it was a helicopter. I had the truck window down and begin to realize I couldn't hear any noise and the lights were moving closer. Curious I pulled over and stoped the truck. The lights were getting quite close by now and I still couldn't hear any noise. So I turned the motor off and called to my wife who was sleeping in the sleeper. I got out of the truck and realized that craft was directly above me. The craft set motionlessly about 20 feet above me. The craft was cicular in shape and the edges were curved up like a ball. It was about 100 feet in diameter. The bottom of the craft was made up of hugh metal sheets that looked like they had been exposed to supreme heat. The craft set directly above me for about 5 minutes. The hugh craft hovering silently above me was to much I begin to get scared. As I started to get back in the truck the craft started to move away. As I said before the moon was so bright I could see for miles in the open desert. The craft started moving and within seconds was out of sight. All of this was done without the slightest sound. Unforunatly my wife didn't wake up fast enought to see the craft.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

They were all a light yellow/green glow of light and traveling in the same direction. They were at the ~height that planes fly based upon some small clouds they crossed above. They could not have been metal because you could see the distinct shape due to the finely detailed illumination of the \"vessel?\" They seemed to be just an energy source. They flew directly across taking ~15 seconds to cross the entire horizon. They also stayed in the same formation and were several miles apart. I know this could not have been a plane or balloon.

It was twinkling fast and white, disappeared for a second, and reappeared flashing red, green, and white.  I called my husband and grandson to come out to the balcony to see this;  my husband had a pair of binoculars (10x25)and used them to better see this thing.  To the naked eye, there appeared to be three spheres, blinking  red, green and white lights, seeming to go one in front of the other, then seperate to the left and right of each other, going up and down diagnonally. We stood there mesmerized watching this for about 45 minutes. Using binoculars, my husband was better able to the action: he observed these objects rotating each other, with two white lights in the front, and the red  and green ones on either side of the shape. One appeared to be stationary, while the others circled it. One remained ,on what we think was the surface of the water for quite some time. When we mentioned this to one of the maids the next morning, she told us that, \"There's always things there, don't forget that Patrick Air Force Base is not to far away.\" Patrick Air Force Base is about 8 miles north from our observation point.",

I was looking out the bathroom window at the cloud to cloud lightning coming from the west, the window faced west.  I noticed to the northwest what I first thought was a star or planet, but it kept moving in a west to east direction, and as it got closer I believed it to be an aircraft trying to out-run the approaching storm.  I saw what I believe to be wing red and green lights on the object which I took as wing markers.  All of a sudden the object turned south and dove very rapidly toward the earth, I thought that it was going to crash.  It stopped its rapid dive , turned to the north and rapidly climbed into the approaching storm cloud and disappeared.",

The area of observation is near O'Hare and Midway airports, and several jet aircraft were in the area flying in normal traffic patterns, for this time of day.  We noticed the object was flying nearly at the same altitude of the jet aircraft, but much faster.  The object all at once slowed down as a B-757 aircraft departed Midway airport, westbound and flew past our position.  We were amazed at this behavior, as if the object was observing the jet. The object then accellerated to the northeast and disappeared in a wink as a B-727 came into view from the east. The 727 entered the O'Hare inbound traffic pattern, flying downrange and turning 180 degrees to begin a final approach. We stood  in disbelief to what we just witnessed.  It seemed that object was right on top of the 727 and then just vanished. Based upon my 25 years in the airline industry, knowing aircraft performance, physical characteristics and traffic patterns flown by commercial aircraft in this area, I have never seen such a strange object or vehicle in this area. I am quite certain the object  was not a military or commercial aircraft. Based upon the following observations: 1) Aircraft operating in the area were distinguished by familiar physical characteristics, dark in appearance with wings, landing lights and anti-collision lights easily seen and flying in a pattern. 2) The object was a glowing, gold/orange cylinder with NO wings and NO tail section, it  changed speeds, and immediately vanished. I have witnessed UFO's hovering near the ground, and flying at altitude in the western U.S.  I have never seen an object or UFO enter controlled airspace until this incident, and frankly, the episode was chilling. I am very concerned about the possibility of these vehicles colliding with commercial aircraft.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

My wife spotted the object first and, curiously, I had seen the same object a week before except it was about 5000 feet altitude and a mile off to the south headed SSE. More baffling is that in August of '98 when my daughter (age 12 at the time) and I were camping at Cougar Reservoir (West slope of the Oregon Cascades, roughly central Oregan) she pointed out the very same type object as it passed over our campground at about 100 knots and 200 feet altitude. She was old enough to know it was a craft not from this Earth and got really scared and began to cry, thinking it was going to come back. A strange side to this report is that as the object passed overhead an Oregon State trooper came roaring into the campground and the overlook across the reservoir. He got out of his patrol car and looked up in the sky toward the object then got back in his car and hauled butt out of the campground.

We consider ourselves normal, everyday people. We don't subscribe to UFO literature and are generally not interested in the subject...although...in my 54 years on this planet I've seen enough strange things in the sky that make you wonder if we're not alone. NOTE: The sighting my wife and I had is about 173 miles east of Portland, Oregon on the south bank---Oregon side of the Columbia river.",

It was a beautiful, silent summer evenening, without any wind.  The sky (and clouds) had some red and orange colors of the sun.  I was in the living room when my father &amp; mother called me to come and take a look at the sky.  There was something 'rare' they said.  My father had his pocket-telescope and we looked at it.  Actually it was my mother who noticed it first.  She must have got goooood eyes because the object was very small (because it was far away).  By the time i was watching, a friend of mine came in the kitchen too (we were all watching through the window in the kitchen) and he saw it too, even without glasses.  I took the telescope and looked at the thing.  It was a glittering thing that didn't move.  I could see that it didn't move because it was placed between two electrical wires (it was much much further than the wires of course, but it was a reference).   I continued to stare at the glittering thing, and saw that it took different colors.  I don't know if they came from the sun or what, but the colors slightly differed (which my friend confirms).  The thing was hanging there for 3 or 4 minutes (that we know) and i (we) didn't stop staring.  Suddenly it started moving up at a constant speed.  It wasn't sensational fast, but if you consider the distance it must have been away from us,it can't have moved very slow neither.  So the thing rose and then there was a real FAT cloud after the thing.  First we (me, my parents and my friend ) really thought it was an aircraft that was crashing! It seemed to be falling. It's a kind of cloud you see after a BOEING aircraft but at least 10 times broader.  The cloud had an orange color (was it a reflection from the sun? it did have approximately the same color) and was moving fast (not from our point of view, but again considered the distance...).  After 1 minute or something the cloud was suddenly vanished.  We looked around and some little further there was again this little tiny glittering object that ! we saw b efore the clouds were there.  Then me &amp; my friend saw the different colors again. After 1 minute it restarted moving.  It was moving further away from us.  Again, when it started moving, these clouds appeared.  When the clouds were there, you couldn't see the object.  Okay, it was real far away from us now, so me and my friend jumped in the car and drove into the direction where it was located.  I had the pocket-telescope with me, i could still see the thing from inside the car.  It was really un-necessary for us to move, because it went MUCH faster than we did, so we drove back home.  The last thing i saw (at home again) was the cloud (but very far away), i stared at it, but at once it was gone. i never saw it back. In my opinion, it was no balloon, that's too slow An aircraft... i don't know, i've never seen such big clouds after a plane.  Besides, what aircraft can hang still in the air? I have absolutely no idea what this was, but it was a strange phenomena. I'm not making this up, i'm too tired for jokes... Maybe someone else has seen something like this too, or maybe it can be explained... I hope to find an answer or hear about it. Bye...",

The sky was clear,and moonless. We witnessed a formation of three \"military fighter jets\", displaying normal navagational lights, and flying at apx. 15,000 feet on a due West heading. We clearly heard the familier sound of their engines. Trailing the formation of fighter jets (at apx. the fighter jets 8 o'clock position)was a quite large \"Chevron Shaped Object\". We were able to see shapes quite well, as the OBJECT and the Jets were being backlit by the starlight of the \"Milkey Way\". Using the fighter jets size as reference, we estimated the OBJECT size to be 100 yards from tip-to-tip of its Chevron Shape. The OBJECT had three \"white colored\" lights -- one at the apex, and one at each end(or wingtip)of the \"Chevron Shape\". The OBJECT did not display ANY OTHER navigational lights. The OBJECT matched the jets air speed and seemed to move more like a glider than a powered aircraft. The OBJECT and the jets were observable for apx. 2 minutes. My girl friend and I are very familier with the air traffic in the Tioga Pass area of Yosemite. There is a major East-West commercial air traffic corridor that follows the trace of Tioga Road (HWY 120). The steady stream of air traffic is quite familier and predictable in this area. Military flights are also quite common in this area. The flight path of the OBJECT and the three military jets we observed was south of and parallel to the commercial air corridor that follows Tioga Road. Neither one of us have ever seen an \"aircraft\" the size of the OBJECT we saw. Both of us are highly trained and experienced professionals (Health Care and Photojournalism) with keen observational skills and are certain of our observations that evening.",

DFW Airport is located approximately 20 miles from my point of view, so I thought it was an airplane since planes fly in the area all the time.  However, this light moved at the speed of a military jet. Suddenly the light came to a complete stop at about the two o'clock position in the NW part of the sky. It was still much larger than a star with a brightness consistent with Haligen lights.  In a matter of minutes, it began to wane in size comparative with the stars around it.  As it got smaller, the white light appeared to pulsate with color.  I had binoculars with me and promptly used them for a better view.  This object, or whatever, twinkled and pulsated with red, green and white colors. At times it appeared to have a strobe effect.  I never took my eyes off of it and waited for it to make a move.  Except for a small, gradual sway of motion to one side of the other, it successfully disguised itself as one of the stars, staying in formation with them, even throughout the earth's rotation.

Last night I couldn't sleep and was laying in my sleeping bag looking up.  I had just seen a shooting star a few minutes earlier and so was watching the sky carefully.  The event started by my seeing what I first thought was a satelite.  Very shortly after though, I heard the roar of a jet plane.  I have been camping here for several months, so I'm familiar with the jets that normally pass over the area.  This jet was excessively lowd and I was confused for a second.  Then the jet came out from behind a tree and I could see that it was following the \"satelite\" which I could now see clearly was at a low altitude.  The light and the jet had both come from the west and had apparently just cleared the mountains west of Los Alamos.  The object and jet maintained the exact same distance for the entire time of the incidence.  They both flew directly over the lab and much lower than any aircraft I had previously witnessed. It looked as if they were tied together, since the distance between them never varied.  The light in front continued to look like a satelite the entire time, while the jet had it lights on and was clearly blinking and showing its normal lights.  I looked at the object as it went by and couldn't see any shape and couldn't tell how big it was.  The jet was obviously \"after\" it.  There was no sonic boomb, so the two objects were going less than the speed of sound, however they were moving much faster than the commercial jets which fly over often.",

The light was tiny and it looked &amp; moved like a satellite in polar orbit, but the time of sighting would seem to preclude that possibility, as the sun has been down for some six hours. It \"came on\" slowly while moving directly south, increased in brilliance over about 1 second, stayed lit at around magnitude -2 to -3 for about another second, then dimmed &amp; vanished over the next second, never to reappear.  I tracked its projected course until my view was obstructed by the exterior wall of my own building, and did not see it light up again.  The color did not change, and no trails or tails were left behind. Once it dimmed out, it could no longer be followed. The apparent size was smaller than the head of a common pin held at arm's length. The two meteors I observed earlier this morning before sighting this object both travelled very quickly (est. many tens of thousands of MPH), on a generally southeast-to-northwest track, and were colored white and blue-white respectively. One left a blue luminescent trail for a brief time.  This object was nothing like them.  The speed was all wrong, the direction of travel was wrong, and the color of the light wasn't a typical \"meteor\" color compared to any meteor I've ever seen. Any ideas?\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>At 0230 hrs. local time, no man-made satellites would be visible overhead.  They would be in the Earth's shadow, and therefore not illuminated.  If a satellite is not reflecting sunlight, it almost certainly is not visible to a person below without special optical equipment.  PD",

For 15-30 seconds or so, it sped across the clear sky in a straight line, leaving a substantial tail which dissipated fairly quickly as it crossed.  At first I thought it was a Navy type flare that some yahoo had set off for a lark.  It was the same size as such a flare and had the same velocity as those I have seen set off around here on New Year's Eve.  However, the light was a very bright white, not orange or purple.  After its rapid, soundless progress almost directly overhead, it disappeared from my view plane behind trees and a bright streetlight, having maintained its constant speed, trajectory, and brightness throughout.  I have no idea what it could have been, though I suspect that it was a large meteor or a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.  It was probably nothing out of the ordinary, but it would be reassuring to have it identified. Please let me know if you have heard anything about it.  I can't believe that I was the only one who witnessed it. It was a real thrill!",

I live in Waterloo, about 1 hour west of Toronto, and on  Wednesday, Aug. 8th, shortly before 11PM I was outside waiting for the dog to \"do her business.\"  While waiting, I just so happened to look up northwest (at an angle of 45-50 degrees), and saw what appeared to be a slightly \"out-of-focus\" ball of white light flying across the sky at a tremendous speed.  It was about the size of my baby finger-nail held at arm's length. It's altitude must have been quite high, since there was absolutely no noise whatsoever, but it went from nearly the western horizon to the eastern horizon in a matter of 5 or 7 seconds.  I would have passed it off as a \"shooting star\" or small meteor, but the strange thing is that there was no tail, and it did not fly in a perfectly straightward path. It seemed to meander slightly as it shot from west to east, like an bee flying from one flower to another.  Have you heard of anything else like this?  Thank you.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted))",

I was attending a wedding reception last night at the Princess Mary restaurant in Victoria, British Columbia. At the restaurant on the top floor was an outdoor patio where guests of the wedding would go to smoke and socialize. The group (5 in number) which had gathered on the patio were talking about how beautiful the moon looked coming over the western horizon and we talked about the number of shooting stars which had shown themselves throughout the evening sky. Just as we finished discussing the shooting star, which I had just witnessed, one of the people in the group yelled, \"What is that\" and pointed above us looking east in the night sky. It was a group of about 6-7 oval shaped objects traveling in a straight-line formation. They didn't seem to be lit up by their own luminescence but since they were traveling over Victoria near the city center it looked as though the city lights lighted them up. The objects appeared to be a grayish in color. It was also hard to tell exactly what altitude the objects were traveling. We couldn't discern any noise coming from the objects throughout the entire sighting. They proceeded to move in a westerly direction until they began to form up into a new formation in an square/rectangular shape and began to ascend into the sky almost directly above the city center. At this point the videographer who had been hired for the wedding was called out on to the patio and we all pointed to the objects in the sky and told him to start taping the event. A few other people who came out on the patio also witnessed the formation and their ascension. The objects continued a slow climb in the square shape formation. As they got smaller we could see their lights flicker and at this point it was hard to make them out. However, we did see some of the objects seemingly streak off into space, but I do clarify at this point they had become faint star -like lights. All of us who witnessed the event just stood there in disbelief but we all had to agree we just saw something unexplainable and it clearly was a UFO sighting. The sighting happened on August 12, 2001 at approximately 12:15 AM to 12:30 AM. The duration seemed to be around 3-4 minutes and the weather was clear. My background is I'm an amateur historian and currently work in the IT industry. The other witnesses: One is a chef One is a student of Computer Programming The Videographer, I don't recall his background The person who first spotted the object has an insurance background The other witness who saw the whole event I do not know personally A few others who came out later during the sighting Come from various backgrounds.\n\n\n\r\n((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nPeter,\n\r\nI'm wondering if I can update my witness account I sent you earlier today.  I seemed to have noticed I had my directions in reverse. The objects we saw were a little to the west of us moving on an easterly heading and the moon was rising in the east. I noticed on your website you posted the report and you correctly pointed out my error. In my haste to get the my account written and with not getting much sleep last night, I made the error. Could we change it to reflect the proper headings?\n\r\nThank you...\n\r\nWarm Regards,\n\r\n((name deleted))\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  We believe that the witnesses were looking into the southern sky, and the Moon was rising in the east, where it usually is seen when rising.  Please see other reports for the same date.  PD",

I live 55 miles due north of RDU so it is common to see a jet every few minutes at these altitudes descending into RDU.  They are almost always going due south; this one was going south east.  That caught my attention first, I next looked for wings thinking this must be a jet but could not find any.  All I could see was a large cigar shaped white-gray object with a slight glow about it, the size of a blimp, but moving along at a  rate much faster than a blimp is capable of.  I next started to reach for my camera, as I did the thing seemed to shift into warp speed and with in two or three seconds put a lot of distance between me and it.  I would guess it was maybe three to five miles distant when I first saw it, then with in ten seconds a spot in the distance.

At least a couple of football fields long, made no sound whatsoever.  It was around 9:20 Mountain Daylight Time.  August 12 of 2001.  I was so extatic.  I rushed into my house to grab the digital camara.  I also was able to take several pictures of this craft. At first, I thought it was two seperate craft with bright red pulsating lights.  However, they were in syncronization with each other.  So therefore it had to be one craft.  They were coming from the direction of Rocky Flatts (nuclear facility) and also our local small airport here.  It was moving from the NW to the SE in the direction of Downtown Denver so I'm hoping a lot more people would have seen this object.  If you have any questions, my email is ((e-address deleted))  you may request photos of this sighting.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We will request a copy of the photograph.  It is not clear whether the sighting occurred during daytime, or at night.  We will attempt to clarify this point with the witness.  PD",

I pulled off the road into a big rock pit and reclined my car seat and layed back to watch for more.  I have seen them before and they ussually showed up more than one at a time. shortly agter seeing the star I noticed something slowly coming towards me in the same path that the star was in.  It was a triangular and had lights on it.  The craft was fairly high but came lower as it aproached my vehicle.  It had 4 lights on the front of it.  Two of them were red and two of them were blueish white. It moved extremely slow and it made zero noise.  It literally scared the piss out of me when it hovered infront of and around my vehicle.  As it left my area I could see that it had maybe six to ten bars of light on the back.  They were as tall as the craft and I noticed that two of them were red and two of them were blinking white.  That is about much detail as I can remember.  I am still in shock.  It actually was very scary for me.  It looked exactly like something you would see on unsolved mysteries or some ufo show.  I have always believed in them but now I know they exist.  Anyway that is about all that I can say right now.  Is there any expanation for what I saw?  could the \"star\" been the ufo entering the earth?

Then later that night, under a magnificent sky, to the south, we noticed a white orb.  This orb flashed, then split into two smaller white orbs.

My 2 friends, my brother and I were out late that night (after 10:00 pm). I was 11 yrs, my brother 9, the others about the same age. We were playing some game on the sidewalk, and we noticed a huge yellow light in the sky, approx. 1/16 diameter of a full moon. It seemed to be very high in the sky or in space. The small airport called Sunland Park was visible in the west accross IH 10, and the lights from some small planes could be seen in the vicinity of the airport. The light was very high above the airport, and slowly moving to the north. We were excited, and I said to my friend that we should run up the block to his house to get his new telescope. At first he didn't want to, being afraid we would miss something while we were running up. But it kept moving so slowly that he agreed, and we sprinted up the street to get the scope. When we got to his house his Dad was out getting ready to call him and his brother in. He said \"Dad, LOOK AT THAT!!\", and his Dad took a long look at it, then called his wife and the older sister out to look. By this time, the light had crossed 1/2 the horizon, but was still very high (in space?). Soon thereafter it stopped moving, and after hanging there for 15 secs. or so, it began dropping smaller yellow lights out of the bottom, one after the other. The lights were about 1/10 the size of the larger light. It proceeded to drop about fifteen of these. The craft was at about 10:00 high, and these smaller lights would each disappear at about 08:30 high. When they began disappearing, the number of them and the realization that they could fly over us invisibly made my knees start to wobble and give out from fear- the only time in my life that has happened. After the last of the lights fell, four lights simultaneously broke off the object at each corner or quadrant, then fell to the same area and disappeared. After that the entire craft just blinked out. I looked around the neighborhood, and some other neighbors saw this as they! were ou tside watering the grass and others working on a car.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

We were camping out on the river by Salmon La Sac, Wa on Friday night.  It was a brilliant night, milky way very visible.   Sitting by the river in almost complete darkness, the moon had not risen yet, we noticed a very bright white ball hovering to the south of us.  Initially we thought it was venus, due to the fact it was due south, but when we cinally focused on it (2 minutes) it became apparent it was moving downward to the peak of this mountain. We then observed it after 1 minute, explode non-violently into two smaller spheres, and float around.  They moved toward the very top of the mountain when a craft appeared heading toward it. No noise, not fast, almost as if it was coming into land on or in it.   The craft was about the size of a bus from our vantage, as we could not really see the craft, we could only see the four lights under it.  None of the lights signified it as a airplane, as none were blinking.  The lights were 2x2 and were glowing a very magnificient orange. The craft got closer, to the two spheres, and they both went over the mountain, out of our view.  Then a second ship, identical to the first, made the same trajectory towards the location of the others, and almost zig zagged to manuever over the peak of the mountain. There were other sightings that evening from others at the camp, but this was the only one I was privy to. This location is far from any municipal or federal airport.

Saw from commercial airliner.\n\r\nI was on a SW airline flight from San Jose to Phoenix, ~35,000 ft and 500 knots. I don't know the exact location because the plane flew futher west than usual to avoid a thunderstorm. We were over CA 15 minutes before because I recognized all of the city lights from the San Jauquin valley. Then everything went black, so I assumed we went far enough east to be in Nevada. I was looking at the lightning going mostly cloud to cloud in a 50 mile wide thunderhead to the east at about 40,000 feet. Then I saw red and green lights fly at a 90 degree angle to the plane (I was on the left side of the plane, and it was flying east. I assume we were flying south). It was flying at about 20,000 ft. I watched it for a few seconds, and didn't think much of it until I noticed how fast it was going. I spent four years in the Air Force, so I just thought it was a fighter. It was going at least 1,000 mph, because it was going at least twice as fast as other airliners going perpendicular to the one I was in. I always get a window seat and I spend most of my flying time looking out the window. Then I noticed that the lights were not flashing periodically like a plane, but randomly. Sometimes there were more than one red, and the lights didn't stay on for the same durations either. It actually looked like the whole aircraft was either red or green because I could not see an aircraft body unless it emitting either the red or green, even when lightning lit up the sky, which it did at least once. I watched it intensely. After about five seconds, it did a u-turn (changed its bearing by 170 degrees to about 280) in less than 100 milliseconds. Not only are there no planes that can do that, that stunt would have instantly killed anyone in the aircraft because of the g-forces. Then after about one-two seconds of heading almost straight toward the plane, but still 15,000 feet lower, it headed straight up to about 25,000 feet in less than one second. I figure one mile per second is 3,600 mph, straight up. Then it changed course and he! aded NE and disappeared into the thunderhead in less than one second, at a speed more then twice before. It seemed to be seeking out the lightning. In other words, If I was in an aircraft with that much capability, and I wanted to be hit by lightning, that's the exact flight path I would have took, assuming that I was coming from the west. About five minutes later, I asked the stewardess to ask the pilot if they saw anything on radar back then. They said no other aircraft in the vicinity for longer than that. After we landed, I told the pilot and he didn't seem to care and told me to report it to the FAA if i wanted to. That's all folks.",

            "characteristics": "Lights on objectUFO SITING 06/15/01 ALONG I-25 IN COLORADO\n\r\n06/15/01 SITING \tThis is written from my notes taken on 05/06/01 hours after my siting.  On 05/06/01 at approximately 00:30 hours I had left my place of employment in the City of Longmont, County of Boulder, State of Colorado.  I was traveling in the left-hand lane of I-25 heading north bound from highway 66.  At approximately 00:48 hours I was north of the Mead exit cresting a hill.  Upon cresting the hill my attention was drawn to an abnormally bright white colored light in the sky north of my location.  At first I thought it was a commercial aircraft far off several thousand feet up in the air.  It should be noted that I-25 runs all the way to Wyoming and this section of highway goes threw both Larirmer and Weld County.  It is very unusual to see commercial aircraft flying in the air space of these Two County's, but I have seen commercial air traffic from time to time flying in these County's. I continued to watch the light and noticed that it never move to the left (west) or the right (east).  I figured that the light was either moving north (away from me) or that it was moving south (towards me).  As I proceeded down the hill I observed the light was now back dropped by the next hill.  I realized that the light was both closer and lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I continued now going up the next hill where this object appeared to be rather close to a bridge.  It should be noted that this bridge crosses over I-25 for east and westbound traffic.  The bridge is located south of mile marker 246 and part way up the hill.  The bridge also has no off or on ramps connecting to I-25. As I approached the Bridge the object appeared to be approximately 200- 300 feet directly above the bridge.  I also observed that there was a red colored light to the right of the white colored light approximately 30 feet apart.  In-between both lights I observed a very dark mass that appeared to connect the two lights.  At this time the object appeared to take on a shape that is similar to that of a cigar.  When I got closer to the object I noticed that the object had some depth to it.  My view changed to where I could see part of what I would assume to be the underside.  The black colored mass appeared to come from the red light heading in a north western direction (away form me) rounding off and headed towards the white colored light. With this new view it took on the shape of a rounded triangle. Just before I proceeded under the bridge I lost my view of the object due to the bridge and the height of my windshield.  I continued under the bridge and traveled approximately two tenths of a mile further and pulled over to the right side of the highway.  I exited out of the driver\u2019s side of my vehicle and looked where I had last seen the object and it was gone.  I did not see any sign of the object around the bridge.  I looked to the east and west along the road connected to the bridge and I did not see any traffic.  The traffic on I-25 both north and southbound was light/ few vehicles and there were other vehicles present at the time.  I looked up to the sky and I saw no signs of the object or any visible signs of any air traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and went home where I then wrote down what I had observed. During this time I did not observe any running lights that one would see on aircraft be it rotary or strobe type.",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Electrical or magnetic effectsmultiple lights moving in unison at distinct angles\n\r\nI was traveling with a friend north on US Hwy 51 on the night of August 2, 2001 the sky was completely clear, and as usual full of stars, with a full moon over my left shoulder as I drove north. At approximately 00:45 on the 3rd about 3-4 miles south of Mercer WI. and directly infront of us above the road about 1 mile in the distance 3 BRIGHT Yellow -Orange lights appeared. They were \"stacked\" directly above each other. The size would be comparable to the size of your thumb nail when held at arms length, each light appeared to be about 3 - 4 times their diameter apart. The objects were framed by the trees that lined both sides of the road in this area and they appeared to be about 1/4 mile above the ground. They almost appeared to be a ball of flame as I tried to figure out what they could be. We approached for about a half minute at which time I pulled over to the side of the road to get my camera from the trunk of the car. At that time the objects were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, but as I pulled over to the side of the road the objects moved straight up and the distance between each of the objects increased to about twice the previous distance. As we exited the car the objects moved 90 degrees or laterally to our left in a westerly direction in unison about 1/4 mile, now positioned above the trees and the shores of the Turtle Flambeau Flowage (which we could not see) but knowing the area that is where we estimated their position. At the same time keeping the same positions above each other. After retrieving the camera my friend and I watched the objects for about 3 minutes, unfortunatly the camera I had was one of these disposables and was really disposable as nothing turned out, to fast of a shutter I'm sure. But when I started taking pictures with the flash the objects changed formation immediately and formed what resembled a perfect triangle on a horizontal plane with each light forming one corner of the triangle about 1/2 mile above the ground. We watched them for about another minute at which ti! me we de cided to proceed further down the road to try and find a better vantage point to view from. We moved about 1 mile down the road and came to a spot where the trees were a little further from the road, at no time did we loose sight of the objects. As we pulled to the side of the road the objects slowly started to rise at about 500 feet per minute (estimating) At this time I attempted to take another picture with out exiting the car. I put the camera out of the car window and snapped a picture, about 5 seconds later a Pickup truck pulled to the shoulder just a head of us in a spray of gravel. (This was the first car we had seen during this whole time)I pulled along side the other car the driver (about 27 years old) was alone in the truck and his first words to us were \" What the hell am I looking at, I've been watching those things for about 10 minutes. Am I glad I saw your flash go off I knew you guys saw them as well. No airplane can fly like that in 90 degree corners. This was really wierding me out\". At that time we got out of the car again and the lights began to rise more rapidly increasing speed as they got higher. And suddenly they were gone as if someone turned a light switch off, meaning they didn't rise and simply get out of sight. This whole time we heard no sounds at all, from the objects or nature sounds as well. My dog in the back of the car made no attempt to get out of the car like she usually does. We continued into Mercer at this time and as we entered the town we relized that the town was blacked out, no power at all. The time was about 01:00 when we reached my cabin and we had no power as well. Power was restored at about 01:15 on the 3rd out of curiousity I called the power company on the following Monday and they wouldn't tell me what had caused the outage. I am a business owner in the technology field and my friend is a Senior Support Rep for a major corporation we are both 42 years old, I served in the military in a nuclear unit and he in the air force.",

I observed them from the other side of the lake I was staying at. They looked about 3-4 miles away. I stayed at Salmon lake in a cabin for a week with my family, so that is why I do not have all the location information. I had never seen anything like them before, looking at them made me afraid, for whatever reasons I am still trying to understand. The lights were near the horizon and very bright. The light they emitted was a white light. The first light I saw was the brightest. It cast a reflection on the lake. It had 3 different shapes that it kept alternating into every few minutes. The first shape looked like two balls that were stuck together, then it appeared to move closer to me and would turn into a five point star, then it appeared to be moving farther away from me and change into a fine point of light. The light did have an aura around, but you had to look hard to see it. The light appeared to be stationary. A few times it did move rather rapidly, but would stay in near the same place as it moved. The first time I saw it move was when it made a figure 8. A few other times it moved ever so slightly, but didn't really go anywhere. It also made a few \"sparkles\" but that only happened when other aircraft came near it. I saw 5-6 planes go near the two objects, it was hard to see them becuase that didn't have very bright lights flashing like most air liners you see. The planes could have been from the military, it looked like one of them shot a missile at it one time, (that is when I saw the first \"sparkle\") but I dont know if that idea would be true, or becusae I have wathced to many \"UFO\" shows in the past. The 2nd ufo I saw was higher in the sky than the 1st, and it stayed in the same spot the whole time I was watching. It was not as bright and was about 1/2 the size as the 1st light. It had a shape of the two balls stuck togther the whole time. I didn't see the lights come in. I just had gone outside and saw them. I didn't see them leave either. I had watched them for a couple hours and the desire for sleep took over since my family was leaving early in the morning to head back to where I live. I would have stayed to see them depart, but they didnt show any signs of leaving...I could have been there till daylight watching them, or maybe just a few more minutes. I guess I will never know.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the individual was looking at celestial bodies, but that is a guess.  PD",

I was on the beach when I witnessed it. They were all spaced evenly apart from eachother. The center one shot strait upward probably 50 miles, at a great speed. I could tell it was moving faster than any plain possibly could. It stood still for a few seconds till the other one to the left moved upward to. The center craft did a zig zag pattern while moving down the shorline and covered what must of been a few hundred miles making very destinctive zig zag patter in less than a second or to. The third stood very still and then shot strait up very fast and than just simply dissapeared. I could see the first moving object turn sideways and is appeared to be spinning in place. The lights on then at the time were just white. They all went under the horizon. And did'nt come back for probably two minnutes. But the one appeared again. Making very sharp, sudden , and fast manuvers up and down. I truely don't believe plain's can move like these objects were. I returned to the beach the next night. Thinking I would'nt see anything. Much to my supprise i saw a very bright light in the exact same spot i had seen them the night before. And the light satarted doing the same sharp, fast up and down movements as the others. In these same spot! With in a few minnutes 5 plains started moving tword the very low flying object. At this point the object started to have very un- even flashes of light and moved north and dissapeared into the land. Still flying very, very low. The night before a half hour after they were seen a helicopter with a very bright spotlight was flying in the area where i had seen them, shining all over as if they were looking for something- yet there was nothing on the cb radio-at all! I'm not lie or exagerating the least bit. I mean come on why would i sit down for the past hour and write till my hands hurt if i did'nt see anything. Everyone who witnessed these objects were sober as could be. I never really believed, but now there is'nt a doubt in my mind.

I've been an amateur astronomer for 15 years and was in the Air Force stationed at a SAC base for 4 years so I know what aircraft look like in flight, my immediate first thought was this is a Super-Nova I'm seeing.  I was astonished, visual supernovas are so rare I thought I was a lucky person to actually witness one...well after watching it for over a minute I noticed it started to move VERY slowly to the north against the background stars.  Well that night if you check the weather records in my area we had wind gusts of 22mph going southeast so this object would be going AGAINST the wind.  Well it sped up and winked out....if I were to hold out my fists in front of me I'd say it went from a stand still to disappearance within 6 fist-sizes, also I don't have any Idea of how big it was I just have the impression it was up incredibly high, I heard no noise and saw no shape, just that incredibly bright light....and I know about the perseids, this wasnt a fireball or anything of the sort, and it isn't a planet since there isnt any planet that would appear at the zenith let alone any bright ones like venus or jupiter... it's EXACTLY like I said, it was stationary for over a minute then slowly accelerated then winked out heading north......\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Had the lights been close to the horizon, as viewed from the vantage point of the witness, we would first have suspected that he might have been looking at the landing lights of approaching aircraft.

A friend and I were star gazing. We noticed flashing lights off in the distance, 1 foot above the western horizon; red, blue and white lights flashing. It appeared to be a satelite at first. As it approached us, we began to think it was an emergency plane or helicopter. It was travelling very quickly. It flew/drifted almost directly above us, and as it did, 2 more lights became visible for 10 to 20 seconds. It had a pyramid shaped bottom. Then as it passed by, the 2 front lights faded, and 4 lights were visible again, but in a reverse pattern. The wind picked up at about the same time as it was above us, so we don't know if it made any sound. We watched as it dissapeared 1 foot above the eastern horizon. Whatever it was, it came toward us from a point above the horizon, and went away above the horizon; it did not follow the curvature of the earth. It was very, very high in the sky while above us. It was visible for a total of about 5 minutes. It never stopped or slowed down. We don't know if it's related, but we also saw a bright flash in the sky, shortly after this craft went by. The flash was bright enough to dimly light the sky and ground. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before, and we tried to think of what it could be. I've personally seen many aircrafts flying above me at night, and can tell the difference between a star and a satelite. This we can't figure out what it is. The aspect that's most puzzling is that it didn't follow the curvature of the earth. It went by the earth in a straight line.",

I got up to go to the kitchen, but my husband was in the middle of telling me something, so i stood, facing him, listening to him.  He was sitting up resting his back on the wall underneath our window, so when I stood up I was facing the window (we had the blinds up).  While I was looking at him, a bright light outside the window caught my attention.  The object was very bright--it seemed to 'twinkle', and was gold in color.  My husband noticed that I was no longer listening to him and asked what I was looking at.  I told him about the bright light in the sky, and just as I finished telling him, I looked back at the object and I noticed that it was now many colors--they seemed to pulsate.  I'm not sure of all the colors, but I know that one of the colors was green and another was red--whenever the red one 'blinked' it was brighter that the others.  Almost immediately after seeing the object start to blink, two other objects 'appeared'.  They were exactly like the first one I had observed, and all three together formed an 'upside down triangle' in the sky.  They were motionless for about a minute, then began moving slowly, staying in their triangle formation.  My husband also witnessed this.  We stayed at the window to see if they would come back, and they did in about a minute.  This time, however, they were not in formation and there were only two of them.  They were split apart--when the three were together they were positioned between 2 trees, so they were in clear view--this time there was one behind each tree.  Neither of the trees were thick with leaves, and the objects' lights were still blinking, so the objects were visible.  They stayed behind the trees for a minute, then went way, then came back about a minute later, then went away again.  We did not see them after this.  My husband doesn't really believe in UFOs, so he keeps telling me that they were just airplanes or helicopters or something, but I ! used to live in Latrobe, near the airport, and also near a hospital, so I know what helicopters and airplanes look like, and believe me, these objects were neither airplanes or helicopters.  Also, my cat was acting really strange all through the night and this morning.  She got under the covers last night to bite and scratch one of my feet (which she has never done before).

A friend of mine and his dad were coming back from the Bellaire movie theater in Euless. during the drive home we saw a long line of cars on what seemed to be a back road that we were on. all of the cars were stopped as well as ours. Just to the left of us and all of the other cars was a huge oval shaped craft about the size of a football field. it was covered in lights and moving extremely slow. it looked to be a hundred feet off the ground. it was so long ago that i cannot remember what happened after that. I know there were alot of other cars there that were watching the same thing. Im twenty five years old now and have tried to find anything in the old news papers relating to the incident at that time. It happened during the time Tron was in theaters.Upon asking my friend about it years later he acted strange and avoided the question.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

Until I started to move towards it in the feild it had been about 100'foot in the air and the closer I got it moved away slowly I was stopped by a railroad track and it stopped also and then it moved up and down and back and forth real slow and I realized it was a ball of lite greyish white glowing and not sending out a beam also no noise.  I started to get nervous so I drove back to the woods I came from and shut the engine off again to try and here it still no sound I watched for a while as it moved slowly down to the ground and sat there for awhile It seemed about 50-75 foot across and I got within 2000 foot of it at the closest got scared and started the car to go in around the block and come in from the otherside of the mile square and as I got closer it went up and disapeared so I went home to get my son or a friend to come back and see it, but I found no one at home to go with me. So I went back out and on the way I saw it again any this time it was a mile over by a farmers house so I went straight instead of turning to where I was before and went as fast as I could towards to object and about a quarter mile away it took off this time real fast before it disapeared again off to the east and that was the last I saw of it.I didn't realize untilafter thinking about it that it put off no light and yet it was aball of light.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

At first I questioned it to be Mars, but it began to slowly move to the rifht in shaky movements. The orange/amber object continued to move towards a a patch of trees in the foreground, though after watching it for about 30 minutes, it began swaying from side to side. Also when a normal airliner flew overhead, it made a sudden, quite agressive (about a 45 degree) turn to the left, away from the object. The object continued to move in this manner, often in almost a circular way until finally disapearing behind a large group of trees.  Also a witness, my brother's girlfriend.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have corrected the date to August 15, which we assume was the correct date.  Also, we suspect Mars.  If a witness stares at a celestial body in the night sky for even a short period of time, the person generally will report that the object appears to be moving.

We were just north of Round Rock on *-35 when I looked over towards the group of radio towers to the northeast.  It was dus, but still there was a good amount of twilight out.  The sun I believe had set a few minutes or so minutes earlier.  Above the antena group, I saw this jet black rectangle that had four small white lights on each corner and in the middle was a greenish gold light in the center. It hovered there for what seemed to be a couple of minutes.  My partner and I watched it as we were driving northbound on the interstate.  We knew what radio stations were broadcasting from that tower group.  We tuned in those radio stations and there sememed to be no interfearence from the object.  Shortly thereafter, the light in the middle of the object turned a bright greenish white and took off at an incredible accelaration towards the north north east.  There was no sound from the craft during hovering or during it's departure. I figure that the size of it was roughly the same as a football field, judging it's position relative to the ground and radio towers.  At the distance we were at, it was about the size of your hand held flat and pointed across your line of sight.  That's the last we saw of it.",

After maybe 10 min, it is getting bigger and nearer and so we decided to stop on the road because we got curious. We both dont believe in UFOs but when we stepped down we get to see a certified UFO. It stopped on top of us as if they really wanted us to see them. It is triangular in shape and full of white lights covering the whole triangular shape. It also has a single blue light on one wing and a single red light on the other wing. We stood staring on it with amazement because we dont know what it is because for sure its not a plane because it stopped on top of us and its not a chopper also because it is so quiet.

I got then one frame clear, then the next frame seemed to show a white diffuse disc shape in the same place as the blue 'flower'. (I thought \"uh-oh\". The next frame showed no headlights ,the 1st frame without in over an hour now, and over the area ,an even fainter glowing line visable,but still below the horizon of Popo.

            "characteristics": "Aircraft nearbySilver cigar over Central Missouri\n\r\nThis morning as my sons and I were outside preparing to get in the car, I heard an unusual sound which I have in fact noticed on several occassions in the past months.  Certainly not highway noise, and while similar to typical aviation noise, somehow much more \"otherworldly\" sounding.  This is such a subjective description, but is the best I can come up with.  We live along a creek banked by steep cliffs and have a deep ravine originating near our home that opens into the creek in a break in the cliffs.  I mention this because I believe this feature can amplify aerial noises.  I will also mention that I have been an avid sky watcher for almost exactly a year now, my interest originally having been piqued by stumbling across info on the web re: anomolous contrails, aka chemtrails.  Within a month or so of reading about them, they began appearing frequently in our skies, typically the result of what I would  say, from the planes I have viewed, are military jets doing some kind of exercise. In any case, this morning the skies were almost pure blue, but typically upon hearing that unusual noise planes will appear and the skies slowly haze over... This morning something totally unexpected happened. A cigar shaped object appeared at an altitude just under the few clouds (cirrus) in the sky, slowly moving west to east.  While the strange noise was coming from a distance through the ravine, there was no sound whatsoever associated with this craft. It was uniformly silver, with no wings and no windows that I could observe.  It had no contrails coming from it.  My best estimate as to its size would be that of a typical tractor-trailer only wider.  It had the shape of a medicine capsule, therefore I would call it a cigar shaped object for classification purposes.  Within approximately 2 minutes this slow moving craft ascended at perhaps a 15 degree angle and poof! disappeared from view.  I have been thinking about it all day - it was so unusual.  Within a minute of seeing this object, a military (I assume) jet ap! peared i n the sky emitting a contrail at about the same altitude.  Back in March, I was driving near my home looking at lingering contrails and noticed a jet - traveling next to it towards its rear was a silver orb a bit smaller than the jet.  I wished to observe this by following it in my car but had someone tailgating me, so I was unable to make a turn in order to observe more.  Other than that sphere and the cigar witnessed this morning, I have NEVER seen anything like these craft before in my life and would rule out explanations such as \"blimp\", \"weather balloon\" or the like.  I have never \"believed\" in UFOs but the sighting this morning, as well as the orb some months back, have me convinced that there are at the very least craft of whatever origin whose operating mechanisms are nothing like those the general public are privy to.",

Oct 15 - very quiet and still to slow moving\n\n\n\r\nWhen I first saw this there was not many posts for this type of siting and I let it go except for one post I made to some Purdue researcher that I never heard back from.  However, this is what happened. I was coming back from the computer lab at UMO and noticed a light over the trees as I passed in front of the gym.  Anyway it struck me as odd and I pulled into the parking lot on the ball fields side and looked at it. I realized that it was on my way home about over by the dairy farm.  So, I got back in my car and went like I was going to the dairy farm and while on the way I could occassionally see the glow of the light ( bright white ). As I got closer I saw the source of the light was hovering over the edge of the field.  As I turned into the road that went to the farm I almost immediately pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  I looked at the clock and it was nearly 8 pm. I looked up at the craft and some things that struck me were the following: it sat as still as if it were on a stand somewhere between 300-1000 feet in the air.  It did not appear to be that big (about the size of a small school bus but wider. ) It appeared to be pretty flat and shaped like a shortened home plate (more delta shaped than rectangular). As I stood there I could no longer see the source of the light because I was a little under it and behind it (the light source on the object) .  I could see the glow of it though.  The next thing that struck me was the sound it made.  It was very quiet but it sounded kind of like a jet engine with the volume turned way down.  No other lights or sound was evident.  The night was still as could be. I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes and at that point it headed towards Route 2 going to Bangor.  As it got close to Brewer I lost site of it because the road was under construction and I could not get into town quick enough to get across the bridge. It never went very fast.  It was still for at least 10 minutes in the beginning and then I followed it for another 5-7 minutes as it followed the river.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We presume \"UMO\" stands for University of Maine at Orono (Maine).

It first appeared to me just below the top of my windshield at about a 30 degree angle above the horizon, appearing to flare up at that point to a bright yellow-white color with a long tail and sparks and small chunks breaking off. It was about half to 2/3rds the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. It dropped almost vertically to a point just above the ridgeline of the foothills, and appeared to dim out just before disappearing. While very hard to estimate distance, if I had to venture a guess I would say 5 to 20 miles, though it could have been much further. It looked to me that it very likely hit the ground relatively near Denver. (A call to the USGS for seismic cooberation was quite unsatisfying) I had my hand held GPS operating, and checked the current heading at that time as 201 degrees. I am trying to confirm if that is magnetic or true heading, but the GPS manual does not specify. It appears to be magnetic heading based on my aeronautical chart and the road in that area. The object was just slightly left of straight ahead, so most likely about a 195-200 degree magnetic heading from that intersection. Plotting this on my Denver Area Chart (aeronautical chart), the line runs nearly through Marshdale, Silver Springs, and Bailey Colorado. (If my GPS course turns out to be True Course, shift the line 10 \u00bd degrees to the left, but magnetic course looks right on the map). This was one of the most spectacular, low and close objects of this type I have seen, and if my small plane were not in the shop I would go out looking for evidence. It may be possible if able to triangulate or get a seismic location to find a relatively pristine meteor or space debris. I don't know who to contact about meteor impacts, so perhaps you can tell me or pass this on. Perhaps NORAD/Space Command has some info on this object if they will share it with us.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Map sent by witness.

We had been partying with loud rock and roll music with our car doors open, when someone yelled \"look!\", pointing up in the sky.   We looked up and there in the sky was this huge red orb.  It was hard to tell how close.  I thought it actually looked like a planet ~ I quickly sought out the moon.  The moon was clearly visible a great distance from the object.  The reason the orb looked planetlike was because it was fiery red, glowing, opaque and had something around it, like a grey cloud or through it. Fortunately or unfortunately it just hung there.  It made no sound, it didn't move.  We watched for maybe 1/2 hour, then people got worried, jumped in their cars and we all drove off.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date and time are approximate.

My wife also saw it as she was sitting in the right front seat.  Our son sitting in the back seat behind me did not see it.  It was a very clear night and the massing of the Milky Way could be seen just by looking out and up.  There were several private airplanes out and about with flashing lights that were easily seen (but not near the object).  From my vantage point, in front of me and a little to the right (at, say, one o'clock there came streaking down with a long tail (at 15 to 20 degrees from vertical) a small parallelogram with sharp angles, for the corners did not look to be right angles.  I remember that the parallelogram was a double image but I attribute that to the hour of the day and I could not blink to clear my vision or I would have missed it.  My wife did not recall a double image.  If this were painted on my windshield it would have been about 1/4\" long and 1/8\" wide and the tail would have been 9 - 10 inches long. The sides of the parallelogram on the right were lower that the ones on the left. To me the color looked blue green, object and tail.  To my wife, she said it looked more toward yellow.  I did see it though a windshield that had a tinted top edge, but I could not reproduce the color by looking at white road signs.  It looked big enough and close enough that we thought it was going to hit the nearby fields and make an explosion or something.  It did not.  It lasted long enough for me to say,\"Geeezz!  Look at THAT! and for my wife to respond.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be quite credible in his presentation of the facts surrounding his sighting.

My friend thought it was venus, but it seemed so large and bright, and it seemed to be lower than most stars and the only star in the direction!  I thought it was the north star but realized we were facing east.  As we were about to dismiss the object as a star or planet, it suddenly darted left (straight north)  for about 3 seconds but seemed to cover a lot of ground in that short time.  We lost sight of it but then turned left as it was the road towards home anyways.  We passed some pines that blocked our view but then came to an open field and saw the bright object again.  It was hovering but then moved upwards quickly and the light totally went out, then came back on again about 10 seconds later.  The odd thing was it was a clear sky, every star was visible, so i figured it couldnt be a plane going through clouds, and the light seemed to large to just be a plane.  We watched the object for another 10 miles, and decided to go just go home cause it was now higher in the sky.   However when i got on my road i could still see the strange object, i tried to video tape it casue i had my camera in the car but the battery died about 3 seconds into taping it,  so we went in my home got my dad and drove back west down my road.  we stopped the vehicle got out and stared north northeast where the object was.  It now was a brilliant blue and red, the lights would flicker much like that of a plane, but it hovered in the same spot for 30 more minutes!!!  Plus i spotted a plane in the south western sky moving east, and it became clear the object was definately no plane.  The strangest thing about it was that it also had 3 white lights, which if connected would make a triangle.  but the triangle seemed to appear, then go away then come back once every 20 seconds or so..  we  watched it  until 11:15 and then decided to return home.  This is the! strange st thing ive ever seen and i hope to see it again.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite credible and convincing.

We knew that the shuttle would be nearby. About 9:32pm, just before we saw the two orbiting vehicles come into view, a bright orange light flared to our SSW about 10 degrees elevation. It lasted about 3 seconds and went out. These lights continued to come on and off for 3-5 seconds at a time for about 18 minutes. They ended promptly at 9:50 pm. With me was my wife and teenage son. My wife had binoculars in the car, and with them I could see very faint strobes literally swarming in the area where the lights appeared and disappeared. As many as three bright orange lights might appear at once, but there were probably as many as five different sources.  Attempting to follow or count very faint strobes in binoculars is not easy, but it appeared that as many as five different strobe sources were present as well. The brightness difference between the stobes and the orange flares was extreme enough that I couldn't tell if it was the strobing crafts that became brilliant or if the source was just very close by.  I enjoy stargazing as a hobby and am familiar with varied phenomenon of the night sky. The appearance of the bright orange lights was in color like that of Mars, which was close by this evening for comparison, but with the brightness of Venus, about 1 to -1 magnitude in range.  The area would be towards the south side of the Army base Fort Leonard Wood, or could have been even further southwest. There was no practical way to triangulate for a proper distance.",

But I then noticed that it had more of the contours of an airplane. I rolled down my window expecting to hear a helicopter sound, but I heard absolutely no sound from the object. The object than started flying very slowly and completely silently at what seemed to be too low of a speed for a commercial aircraft, heading southwards across Wallingford and Lake Union towards Seatac airport.

Then my friend saw a beam of light in the sky (which I didn't see).  The first \"craft\" appeared right where the iridium flash disappeared.  It looked like a disc with flashing lights of blue, violet, red, green white.  All of these light colors were on each of these ships.  There looked like one light of each color on each of these, but they mostly flashed two at a time. This craft was \"hovering\" there, sitting in one spot but sort of moving back and forth just a bit.  Then it shot off to the west very quickly.  It took about two seconds to cross the sky and disappear. Then from the west (not from one particular spot) more came, 1 or 2 at a time.  They looked just like the first one, 20-30 total (I wasn't counting so I am unsure of this).  They traveled at the same speed to the east to the spot where the iridium flash had been.  They each started to slow down right before they got to this spot, almost to a stop.  It slowly went behind the tree (I could see it through the leaves) and right when it came out from behind the tree they disappeared.  Two airplanes did fly over right after it ended, and they weren't anything like the crafts.

I know it wasnt an airplane but i really thought it to be a satelite.I watch it go across the horizon untill it disapairs.Then about 3 minuets after that another one catches my eye,going same direction,same pace, just a light moving acros the sky.I thought wierd i never really seen satelites like that.At this time in not really hiped up about seeing all that because i think it could have been satelites.i was more mad because ive been waiting for like 15 20 mins outside.So i pace around look at more bats in the sky looking north.Then a blue comet type fireball thats seemed to skip on water buzzed by,not super bright but it was wierd,a blue fireball type thing.i thought wow  thats really wierd,maybe im tired.But that had all my attention on the sky.Now not even a minute after i see that fireball another light goes racing acros the sky,much faster than the sattelites but same direction,exept this on was pulsating bright to very faint,that made me run in and get my cousin,she came out and looked at it to for about the last 30 seconds we could see it int he sky.My cousin even said wow that was pretty wierd and as were looking up another faint light goes in a north west direction,pulsating also but still staying pretty faint.that one was going real slow also i saw it for about 4 minuets buzz its way over the ocean.after that i didnt see anything and my cousin went inside because it was getting chilly.Also my frined came by.I hope someone here in South San Luis Obispo county seen it or someone let me know what all these strange lights are.i belive in UFO's and have been seeing alot here.

Straining to see any blinking lights I thought \"where is the engine noise?\" I was listening for gas propellent for balloons. The bright intense light passed overhead and to the east. Still no green or red flashing lights.Then it was just gone, like it went into a black hole or something. The night was very clear and one could see all the stars including the south to north track of satellites.So for this intense light,being the size of a football field,to just disappear as though a switch was flipped off seemed impossible. I went back to get my son and binoculars to go back out.Again a shooting star and then a bright light.Looking at the object through our binoculars we still did not see any flashing aircraft lights,no noise,just motion.The white intense light,smaller though, or the same one farther away, heading in a different direction? Did anyone else see this?",

Our bed is right in front of two windows which are diagonal to Main Street and more specifically a Church with a tall white steeple. I have been an avid star gazer since I was a teen and am familiar with the constellations, north sky circle, and appearance of planets with in the zodiac band. Being fully awake, I lay looking out the window and noticed a REALLY bright star in the sky to the left of the church steeple. I then realized this was too far north to be a planet. I waited awhile thinking it could be a plane but after 5 minutes it hadn't move. I then woke up my husband and we got out our Canon Binoculars and what we saw gave us both wicked goosebumps! The easiest way to describe it is that it looked like a wedding ring - there was one bright white light in the middle with dimmer lights on each side. There was a definite distinctive dark band separating the lights. IT NEVER moved for the 25 minutes we watched it - we don't know how long it was there before 3:40 AM. During this time the light intensity varied. At 4:07 AM - it just got dimmer and dimmer and \"went Out\" - still having never moved in relation to the steeple. The weather was clear - other stars were visible. The sky was still dark - dawn had not set in at all.  I am a high school English Teacher and my husband is in the printing business but also an avid aviation buff.  Of the two, he would be the skeptic and even he was blown away by what we saw.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We would like to know the direction the witnesses were looking.

We were there to observe the stars on a cloudless clear night. An object (which was a dim light, much like a dim star) appeared, it appeared to be a satillite transversing the sky from approximately NNE to the SE. We first observed the object south of zenith and 15 degrees east of zenith. As the object moved to the south we say a brilliant white light (which appeared diamond shaped) flash from it as it travelled south. From where we were standing, it appeared that the flash was directed towards us, as if looking into a brilliant spot lite. About 10 seconds later, it flashed again, the flash was brighter than any other object in the sky by many magnitudes (even the ISS is not that bright). Again after about 10 seconds a third flash was observed, however this flash was directed away from us, as it appeared that we could see the beam of it drifting out in front of the small object. Shortly after the third flash eminating from it, it vanished. Total duration of seeing this object was approximately 1 minute. We just stood there looking at each other and tried to confirm what we had just seen.",

One, in 1977 when I fell down from the tree, one of my legs was injured and my mom got angry about what happened because I was too naughty as a child. My mom punished me by flopping and then I heard the voice from unknown space in the sky. Everyone was shocked at that time, I looked around and then I saw one object looks like two plates combined together, one up and one down flying from that area. I noticed that the voice that object sounds as Khmer language, and if it is translated in English language, it was like this : \"You have to learn to teach your children, Do not hurt him.\". It is also remarkable that the voice of speaking from that object sounds like sound of the alarm signal. Suddenly when everyone looked at around to see source of the voice, that object flying away and disappeared when the bright light covers it. And later at the same place I heard the sound as alarm signal, and about a few months later I heard clearly the voice of laughing and I saw not clearly a few images of the girls through the bamboo tree. and i talked to them that I want food and suddenly a table with a chair appeared in front of me. I sat on it, but when i want to eat that food. That food disappeared and the images of those girls also disappeared. The food was mango, tamarine, salt,.... It is remarkable too that I talked to those girls who laughed at me ( I thought so at that time), my words was that \"If you laugh at me again, I am going to ask my father, God to punish you.\" And later at another one place i have seen another sport plane flying and disappeared into the oval object when the bright light covers it.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

A round craft with 5 large lights around the outside of it, blinking off and on in a cascading pattern, directly to the N less than a mile away. It was fairly large and round, I would guess about 100 feet across. Seemed to be hovering, but weather conditions had low cloud cover that was occasionally covering craft. I asked my wife and 13 year old son \"what's that?!\" and they proceeded to watch it while I drove. The ights just continued to blink off and on until we moved out of sight range of the craft.",

The onely things preventing us from having a good look at it were the highwaylights and (for me) the fact that I was driving the car at 70 m/ph. I thank the Lord that my mother still has her good mind (I'm writing this in the year 2001 when my mother has reached the age of 86) so she still is a reliable whitness to what we've seen and can tell people we're not crazy or seeing things. The thing we saw just hang there on the left of the highway and had blinking lights all around it. I still remember it were green, red and yellow lights, randomly burning. As we rode along the highway (A7) towards Amsterdam, the object seemed to go in the same direction with a reduced speed. My mother and I saw this thing for about two minutes, while talking to each other about it. We both agreed it could not be a plane, helicopter or whatever we thought of. When this UFO (for us it was the only term we could think of) suddenly took of with a velocity that scared us, we were convincend the thing we saw was not of this world. I'm ready to swear on the bible that what i just wrote is the truth (while excusing myself for any errors in the writing) and so is mother.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

The closer it got, the louder it became. I felt a sense of fear as it seemed to pass over the top of our home. I felt that it might crash as it was so close. I immediately got off my computer and turned off the loghts, to see if I could see anything out the window. It was a very skies and stars were very bright, buti could only hear and not see any plane. I saw a huge bright light cross from one side of the lake to another, and then the noise completely ceased for a few brief moments, only to return again, coming closer back over our home once again. I knew that this could NOT be a jet, as it would not have had enough time to turn around so soon, and this is something that jets do not do as a rule anyway. The noise continued to get louder and closer,and disappeared again just as it had done the first time it passed. This time it did not return again and no more bright lights were tobe seen. My husband at the time was on the phone downstairs, but said he had heard the loud and low flying object, he too thinking it was an extremely low flying jet. The very next day in the Lewiston Sun Journal, was a write up of the hundreds of people who had called the Lewiston police, to report the same exact thing as we had heard. Lewiston police called the FAA, and they said there had been NO jets on radar in our area at this time. BTW......all the people who called in to the police reported that it was 10:00 p.m. This phenomoner was also a big story on all the local television news reports Thur.8/23/01. No one seems to be able to tell what it was, but it was darn sure scary. Almost the same thing happened just over one year ago. It was around July 22, I believe. This time it was in daylight, and in late morning. The skies were very overcast, and I was sitting on my back porch, when I heard a plane approaching over my home.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We understand that many reports of this incident were submitted to the news media in Maine.

Our view of the horizon was obstructed by mountains. The view to the North was obstructed by a building. For a period of 4 to 5 seconds, the entire section of the sky that was visible to us was lighted by a bright light whose source I could not see.  The light changed colours, including blue, white, yellow and orange, though I don't recall the sequence.   It appeared as if the source of the light was due South, below the mountain ridge, but since my view North was obstructed it is possible it originated in the North.

Kanata Ontario, Canada.\n\r\nThere was a clear and nice blue sky. I always observe the sky. I was in my car and my wife was driving north. We were going to the movies. I first saw a jet plane flying high going west at an altitude of 45 degrees. I could clearly saw the white trail the plane was leaving behind. I watched the plane until it disappeared in the distance. One minute after, I look southwest and I saw what I first believe to be another plane at an altitude of 30-35 degrees.  It looked to be closer than the commercial jet plane, but you could tell it was very high. It was moving northeast at a steady speed. The first thing I noticed is that there was no white trail, and it was moving just too fast and high to be a glider or small airplane. It looked like a metallic object (commercial jet plane like) but perfectly cylindrical. Looking with more attention, I noticed a quasi-transparent dome shape attached to the top of the object (similar in texture to what you can see when the moon is barely visible during the day)and what appeared to be like a variable haze sorrounding the object. I immediately told my wife to look. Even though she was driving, she could see it too. I though then that it was high altitude balloon, but again the payload seemed just too big and it was moving way too fast. As the object became closer (altitude of 60-70 degrees) I had to stick my head out of the sunroof to look at it. I laugh to myself because the shape of the object was just like a UFO portrayed in a bad cartoon or B movie; transparent dome like with metallic base. As we were moving north, I saw one person walking at the street looking at it puzzled. Once we reached the AMC parking lot, I saw a helicopter flying at ~500m above, this gave me a point of reference. The apparent size was of a big commercial jet plane flaying high. We watched until it disappeared in the distance. For the record, I am an amateur astronomer and I hold a Master degree in engineering. I have many years of working experience.",

I was getting closer and my cell phone rang and no one was there.  I looked later and no incomming call registered in my log on the phone.  I kept driving and then all of a sudden the object darted northeast very quickly and was gone.  I checked the flight schedule at the Central Illinois Regional Airport and nothing comes in from the south at the time.  The Airport is about 10 miles from the sighting.  There is a plane that comes in from Chicago at 11:10.  I could see the landing lights as I was stopped on the road.

It lasted for 2 seconds and disappeared. It started about 2 fist lengths (with arms out) from the West horizon and went west and down. It was very very bright. I hope others have seen this.

At the time I was looking in the diection of Logan Airport so I didn't give it much thought.  For some reason though this light kept catching my eye. I reached the intersection of the street I lived on and rounded the corner all the while keeping my eye on it. it would slowly drift one direction, stop and drift back the other way. Something in the back of my mind told me to stop in my tracks and observe it (which I did) and it seemem to almost be taunting me with the way it moved. It's movements were subtle but most unusual in that it seemed to have no clear direction. Also of note was the fact that the light remained at a farly consatnt magnitude unlike the lights of say a circling helicopter would if one is standing still observing it. It almost seemed to be taunting me as if it knew I was observing it. I must have watched this thing for a solid ten minutes just playing \"peak a boo\" descending just below and ascending just above the tree line drifting left to right. As I watched A black sedan pulled up near me and one of the occupants asked what I was looking at. They were three middle aged men three in the front one riding shotgun. The man in the front passenger side asked what I was looking at. Before I could answer he flashed a badge and said he was a Boston undercover police officer and that people had been reporting UFO's in the Roxbury Blue Hills avenue area. My jaw dropped and I told them I was indeed watching something in the sky I couldn't explain. They asked me a couple more questions that I can vaguely recall and drove off. At that point I felt very unsettled and tried to relocate this object I had been viewing but it was gone. I continued walking down the street keeping my eyes glued to the Eastern horizon and saw nothing until I got to the next intersection. I saw an object flying very silently and very low directly twoards me and i rememb! er feeli ng how surreal it looked because it was somewhat hazy that night and I couldn't make out any detail only that it seemed awfully low and traveling awfully slow. My ears kept straining to hear engine sounds but I heard none. There were two people approaching me and it appeared to be directly over their heads. I asked them to stop and tell me what it was but one didn't even look up, and the other gave me the sarcastic reply \"UFO\" dude. I felt like I was in the twilight Zone. After they past me the craft approached my position and hovered directly over head. I was so surreal triangular in shape silent with a solid red light at the nose and yellow green and blue lights that blinked rhymithicaly counter clockwise. It was huge. The size of maybe the infield of a a baseball field. The thing seemed to have some type of light absorbing field around it like a halo. It hovered above me for what seemed like a minute. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone else across the street and I shouted for him to look at it and tell me what it was. He was by a gas station and I realized from his vantage point he was looking almost directly into a street light. In the moment I asked him and released my gaze from the object it had completely vanished from sight. I could not fathom how something that big could move that fast but it was completly gone from view. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it.It seemed to leaze the air with an ozoney kind of electric charge like just after a thunderstorm.It was the most unusuall/unsettling thing I have ever experienced.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date may be approximate.

We had been relaxing on the backyard deck, watching shooting stars along with my wife, father and father in law.  I couldn't think of any reason any of the \"non-shooting\" stars would be moving and asked her to point them out.  She did and said she was a little bit \"freaked out.\"  There were 3 lights about the same apparent size and brightness as an average star.  They were moving in a triangle from west to east and seemed very high in the sky.  None of the lights were pointing in the direction of travel ; they seemed to be moving with what would be the bottom of a right triangle at the front.  They were traveling slightly slower than a satellite.  A satellite would be the closest thing I could think of to describe this phenomenon but I've never heard of satellites traveling in formation (perhaps they do?).  In retrospect I don't know if it was one object or three, it didn't strike me as a single object at the time.  Had we not been looking directly at the stars for some time we would definitely not have noticed them.  They were silent and if they had stopped, would have been blended in completely with the night sky.  Very unspectacular compared to the shooting stars we'd seen all night but very unnerving.  You had to watch them for a few moments to fully realize what you were seeing.  We watched them travel across the sky for 5 or 6 minutes and they disappeared behind the tree line.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Several similar reports for the evening on this date.  We suspect the objects may be the three satellites that have been reported to NUFORC on many occasions, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Changed ColoOn Friday evening, August 24th 2001, after shopping in Metrotown area of Burnaby British Columbia Canada, my husband and I were heading back in our car to our home of Surrey, B.C. when I looked up in the South West sky, I noticed a object that at first I thought was a blimp. The object was much higher in altitude than a blimp should be.  The alititude that this object was at was at least the cruising altitude of a aeroplane.  It was bigger in size than a aeroplane by a huge amount. The object was very stationary, and had a reddish rustic tinge of colour to it (there were no obvious trails of smoke, there was no movement from this object, it was just suspended there. I told my my husband look at that up there.  Of course, he was driving the car so he had a few seconds here and there to gaze up and look at this object.  He said \"that's strange what is that\"?.  I continued to observe the object in the sky, and he continued to drive the car as we were heading back to our home in Surrey, B.C.  We turned right onto a main road (called Willingdon Avenue) this road would lead us to the freeway back to our hometown.  The journey down \"Willingdon Avenue\" would probably take us about 7 minutes to get us onto the freeway. I kept my eyes on this object in the sky, as we travelled down Willingdon Avenue. I could see the object the whole time, aside from the occasional tree, in the way.  My husband glanced over many times to confirm for himself that it was still there.  So, for about the next several minutes, I observed the object sit there in the sky and not move at all.  As we now came in sight of the freeway sign to take us Eastbound back to Surrey, I looked behind me to get a fix on the object.  It was still stationary for a few more moments.  Then the object moved across the sky at an increadible speed towards the North West. I told my husband \"oh my god\" it's just moved over.  He said \"where, where\"?  I asked my husband to pull over and check this out.  We were on the left side of the HOV Lane (2 or more person freeway lane) we slowed down and stopped the car. (Not a particularly safe place to stop) but we both wanted to check this object out.  I told my husband \"look up there\" as I had been keeping very close tabs on where the object went.  The object now appeared as a dark dot in the sky.  The size of the object at this new location (North Western sky) was about the size at the end of a ballpoint pen.  The colour of the object now was black and the shape of this object from this distance appeared to be a circle.  The object was definately a lot further away than when originally spotted. My husband and I watched the black dot in the sky on the side the freeway. We were running out of time, as we had an engagement that evening downtown Vancouver,so we left from that location, and headed home. We could not believe what we had seen.  My husband said he had never seen an object move with that speed and could not imagine any man made engineered object with propulsion capabilities such as would move a great object of that size at the speed we witnessed. About 1 1/2 hours after we got home to Surrey, my husband and I, had to get back onto the freeway to go to our engagement with family members in downtown Vancouver.  I was again the passenger in the car, and we were now travelling West towards downtown Vancouver.  I was observant of the skys, and I was talking to my husband about the object the entire journey into Vancouver.  We were near the border of Burnaby and Vancouver (but still in Burnaby at this point), I noticed a black object, stationary in the sky again.  I said to my husband \"honey, If I told you I can see it again right now would you believe me\"!??.  He said \"what\"?  I told him \"pull over again and get a look at this\".  He then looked up into the sky, it must have been around 7:30 - 7:45 pm and he couldn't believe his eyes. It was the object again, oval shaped and very dark black background, no light or colours eminating from it, just a large oblong/shaped thing in the sky.  We watched for a few minutes.  Again, we were very pressed for time, so we took off heading for the downtown part of Vancouver. All the way driving into downtown Vancouver , I was fixed on the object which didn't move location for a long time. I observed it for a least 10 minutes more, but after that, it seemed to be getting smaller (probably either moving away (such as going south or it was moving upwards towards the atmosphere), but it definately was going somewhere.  I lost complete sight of the object when we got to the location of 1st and Main Street in Vancouver.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent and credible.  We believe she is not describing here the laser-based advertising light, that apparently was seen over Victoria, B.C., later on the same night.  PD",

Through some low clouds, the craft appeared and it turned out that the light pattern was just 1 side of this triangular object.  The main body of the object was black with rows of lights on each side of the triangle, with 3 bright lights on top at each corner-top and bottom.  The object moved slowly south out of a low cloud, stopped, and rotated about 60 degrees.  When it rotated, it wobbled.  During the entire event, there was no sound (no sound louder than the crashing of the waves on the beach).  I would estimate the object to be approx. 2000ft above the water and 2500 ft off of the beach, and the width of the object itself to be 450 ft or more.  I saw this object fairly clearly and it was large enough in my field of view that I could see many details.",

My friend and I noticed when it started getting distant it looked as though it was droping something, like pieces of it were falling off and then fading away (like little gold drops).  We first thought it might be a flare fizzing out, but since I live in an urban area of Phoenix there are very rare instances where military jets fly over dense areas of the city and I don't remember flares being gold color and traveling at that speed.  We thought the light was going to fade out but it didn't, it kept a constant speed (a little faster than an aircraft.)  There were no sudden speed increases or change in course.  My friend suggested it might be a meteor, but from what I know I don't think it was.  It was too slow for a meteor and too fast for an airplane.  I looked for blinking lights but it had none.  There was an instance where we thought it disapeared because the light faded away, but it came back and then it finally left our line of sight.",

At first, I thought the objects might be large birds, but as they neared, I could see no wings, nor did they seem to act like birds.  They were in a close group.  I turned left (south) on Washington Blvd., went one block, u-turned, and parked the car at Diamond Oaks Blvd. and Washington Blvd.  We both got out of the car and continued to observe the objects. There were six objects, all oval-shaped, no sound, and were maneuvering in various patterns, close to each other.  At the nearest point to us, they were approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, i.e., not directly overhead.  These objects moved under their own power and performed fascinating maneuvers.  For example, they formed three pairs in a loose triangular shape, they would move into straight lines, into a semi-circle, into two groups of three forming a 'delta wing', then move into a curve, etc.  Two or three times, the objects moved away from us, but then they would move in an arc, change from white to bright silver, and come back near us.  At one point, they reversed direction, but without performing a turn.  It was difficult to determine the size of the objects or their distance from us, but I had a strong feeling that binoculars would have been the perfect tool for studying these things, i.e., they were just slightly beyond my ability to see exact detail. As an experiment, my wife removed her sunglasses for a moment, and said that the objects could barely be discerned, as they matched the sky's background nearly perfectly.  But with sunglasses on, they were very discernable.  After five to ten minutes, the objects again formed into two groups of three in a delta shape, and I watched them as they rapidly moved in a north-east direction and vanished into the sky.  We got in the car and drove in the direction they were last moving, but they were gone. I have a B.S. in physics, and am a software engineer working in Roseville.

As it was moving east, it kind of dipped on the right side and disappeared. I looked all over the sky where it had been but could not find it.  I tried to rationalize that it might have gone in to some haze along the ocean, but as we continued north, there was some haze but not enough to cover the size of the object.

Today (8/27/01) when I stepped out my door I first looked at the eastern horizon and noticed the planet Venus.  Then I turned towards the North and noticed a very bright light high in the NW.  Odd because I knew there were no planets in that direction, and no stars that bright (about 2-3 times the brightness of Venus).  My first thought was should I go back in &amp; get my binoculars, or just proceed towards work?  I went back in and got them.  They are Orion 9x63.  With them I expected to see only a point of light, as that is all I could see with my eyes (an apparently very bright, motionless star).  But I was suprised to see a disc.  The object had a visible diameter which immediately told me this was not a star (nova or otherwise).  I became immediately interested.  The color was pure white and very bright.  No details were visible within the bright image and for awhile no details surrounding it.  I kept watching debating whether or not to call my brother (hoping to get a triangulation) and not wishing to take my eyes off it when there was a sudden change.  I noticed the emergence of a \"puff of gray smoke\" off towards the northerly direction.  Inside this thin vaporus and expanding cloud were a number (6-12) of swimming points of light moving somewhat erratically in the same direction (generally northerly).  I then moved closer to the house and supported my arms on a step ladder to steady my view and the same event happened again, thoug the \"puff\" moved generally south and again about the same number of points of light moved off in that direction.  They did not seem to move off with any great rapidity.  The small points of light seemed to have variable brightness to them (some were brighter than others).  They did not seem to move with any purpose, but somehwat sluggishly and randomly and even seemed to slow somewhat the further they got from the bright disc, which never changed position or brightness the entire time.  Now I! really wanted to call my brother and get a triangulation, but just as I was about to do so the entire event ended with the abrupt fading of the entire scene.  Not fading, cutoff.  It just disappeared. The morning was calm, and partly cloudy.  The event was seen thru thin clouds perhaps at 10,000'.  The object was above these clouds the entire time and did not move while the clouds slowly moved in a generally ESE to WSW direction.  Knowing the two locations I stood at to view this event I later used a compass and plumb bob to find the horizon coordinates, which I estimate to be the following: Elevation: 72 deg Azimuth:  300 deg (NW) During Civil Twilight I have observed balloon flights from my house quite often.  This was not a balloon, at least not a hot air balloon.  Hot air balloon are easily identified and are usually accompanied by noise when the fuel is burned for lift.  Even at high altitued one can detect the flare event from from the burn.  If it was a weather balloon (or some reasearch balloon from the University of Alaska) then I would also expect it to have changed position somewhat during the 10 minutes I observed it.  I noticed absoultely no change in position.  There was also absolutely no noise during the entire event.  If it was a balloon venting at high altitude (accidental surface rupture, or deliberate puncture) then I do not understand why the bright central disc did not seem to change position or brightness during the \"release event\".  I also do not understand why the entire event just shut off so suddenly. Thought you might find this interesting.",

As I was star gazing I noticed this star to move in short quick moves repeatedly stopping and pausing still between each short quick swift move. The pauses lasted about 30 to 45 seconds. This was very unusual to me so I continued to watch it for aprox 1.5 hrs. When making its moves, it would instantaneously changed directions from left to right or up and down moving in straight lines. It also moved in half circles. It gradually worked its way in a northern direction. When I looked at it with binoculars, it was mostly fuzzy and blurred from the bright colors. After focusing the long-range binoculars the best I could, I made out a few physical characteristics. The illuminated rainbow colored panels making up the diameter of the object and most of the height. The colors slowing rotated around the object. This was not a star, with out a dought, this was a solid mass object near the atmosphere. I'm assuming it was just outside the earth's atmosphere. The colored lights which appeared to be panels where just bright enough to blur out the rest of the shape. The position and placement of the colored panels made up the horizontally sliced cone shape that I could best make out. Were there any other reports on this ???? please reply..... Im must get some conformation about it before I'll tell to many people.  I\u2019m having trouble getting anyone to return my calls. (UFO agency's, air ports haven't called back) WAS THIS A SATILITE????????? Please reply\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Same witness as for preceding report.

The object was traveling at a speed that would equal, but not exceed that of a commercial airliner. What caught my attention was the fact that the object had atleast 10-12 white lights and 2 red rotating beacons located both fore and aft of the object. I happened to be looking at the moon at the time with a set of binoculars that I had just cleaned, so I was able to zero in on the object. Most commercial airline traffic that crosses this particular airspace does so in a south to north path at approx. 35,000 ft.

What struck me about it being unusual was that it remained stationary in the same position, not moving. It had three colors, red, yellow and green. I thought it may be a helicopter at first, but when it was still in the same position after 15 minutes to a half hour, I thought it odd. The lights flashed. It was not a star, it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. What it possibly could have been was a satelite, if they have flashing tri-colored lights. It appeared the next night in the same position. When I checked it a few hours later, it was father to the south, as our earth moved in its rotation.",

I said, it is a plane with its bright landing lights on, for we are very near Fernandina airport and private planes come and go all the time...But it kept on coming toward us and going lower...I would say descending from maybe 5000? to 2000? ft over a minute or two, but absolutely silent.  The trouble was, it was quite a big circle of light, bigger than any star, white w/bluish tinge soft but strong, like florescent light? When it seemed to be about maybe 2000 ft due east of us, over the sea, it just stopped and remained stationary from then on.  At that point its apparent area was about a fifth the size of a full moon in AREA.  Never any sound at all.  After it had hovered like that about a minute, a mist or cloud was emitted by it from what seemed like 3 sources below its midpoint like at 8 6 and 4 o clock, so that the light came to be \"sitting on\" a small mist or cloud in the completely clear sky.  This is in the dark of the moon, just a fingernail already setting opposite this in the west.  Then it began to emit the mist or cloud also from vents above it, say at ll and 1 oclock.  Thus it was completely enshrouded in the mist but still the light was there in it so the \"cloud\" stood out definitely in the sky for maybe 20 sec.  Then the light was switched off, and the little cloud stood alone in the dark sky.  The size of this cloud was about that of an ellipse with long axis up and down, about what would be covered by a 2 inch or slightly larger cookie held at arms length.  The cloud stood there about 60 sec fading but little, then whoosh, it disappeared in 5 or 10 sec leaving nothing.",

I was nearing the area walmart, and was in a fairly commercial area, there were several cars infront of me, and several behind me. I looked twards the southwest, which is tward the walmart, and I noticed what I thought was an Airplane from the local airport. it had lights on it, just like a plane, but as it got closer something just seemed out of place, it was traveling very fast, and its shape just didnt look right, it was still far away, but getting closer to me and was going at a very rapid pace. I watched it and tried to keep my eyes on the road so I wouldnt crash into anything. I realized that it was definatly not a routine flight from the airport, and it was coming from the wrong direction, it was now flying directly twards my car from the right side. it had a total of 5 lights on it, it had a blue light on the very front of it, a white light just below the blue one, 2 white lights on either side, and a flashing light in the center of it. as it flew directly over my car, I slowed down, and I noticed other cars in front of mine slow down also, so I know I was not the only one who saw it. It finally passed over my car, and I could see it out of my drivers side window. there was no sound at all except for the cars passing by, I could see the shape very clearly now, It was totally black against the moonlit sky, it was definatly triangular and was wide in its shape, the back had no indications of exhaust, there was no smoke either, the back was concave in shape looking sorta like a bomerang but more triangular. I could see only 4 lights on it, the 3 white ones, and the blueish white flashing light in the center, as it passed by, I was shocked when a second one quickly followed the first same shape and same lights. They both were moving at the same speed, and same height above the ground, they seemed to be seperated by about 1000 feet. and couldnt have been more than 1000 feet above the ground there was no sound, and they were moving very fast probably above 300 to 400 mph. I lost sight of them above the top of a hill, and I never saw them agian.",

I did some quick research on the web and found the Satellite came down on March 12 1996 at 11:05pm EST. As I recall, I saw the UFO at about 5.30pm UK time and I think the satellite had come down around midday but I didn't know this at the time of the sighting. I was walking home from the bus stop after college, it was dark but the street lights were still an orange colour as they were still warming up. I glanced up at the moon and a light to the right of it caught my eye, it was the same colour orange as the street lights but was bigger and at about twice their height. I stopped and stared at it, trying to figure out if it was a light on a crane or something but as well as being illuminated it also seemed to have a spherical metallic surface and I started to think maybe it was a helium balloon. Then it started to move, it floated up with a slight arc (not straight up) and seemed to be swallowed up by darkness. I lost sight of it and continued walking, still looking up in case I could see it again. I then noticed some small misty white lights above me, as I looked at them I suddenly realised that they were arranged around the sides of a huge black shape which was blocking out the stars. I'm about 95% sure that it was triangular, it definitely had straight edges and there were 5 lights as I remember. The object pretty much filled my whole field of vision which combined with the fact that it was a black object against a black sky made it hard to be 100% sure about the number of sides. There was also a rectangle of light in the center but it was like light reflecting off a flat raised section rather than a light source, the long edges of the rectangle were sharp and the short ones were more diffuse. The object passed directly over me from right to left, rotating very slowly. It was completely silent, and I'd estimate it was flying or rather floating at roughly treetop level. Altitude and size are pretty hard to judge from below but I would estimate it was about the size of a house and the orange sphere was about the size of a beach ball or maybe a bit bigger. The triangle(?) slowly gained altitude and I lost sight of it as it passed over the houses to my left. I kept looking for it as I continued home but all I saw were the lights from normal air traffic which wer! e at a m uch higher altitude than the object I had seen. I kept an eye on the local press for a few weeks afterwards but I am not aware that anyone else saw this object.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

One evening, I believe the 15th of July, we were sitting outside. It was about 10:00 p.m. I was getting back from the horse stable right outside the fenced property of the house with the man who owned the summer home, a family friend. As we were getting back and approaching the house, I noticed my mom was holding our camera and recording something. Her, the family friend, and I were the only ones outside at the time. I asked my mom what she was recording. She then pointed I believe Southward right over the treeline of the nearby woods. As the family friend and I proceeded to look in that direction, i suddenly noticed a diamond shaped white light. It was completely silent. It was positioned in one location, without moving even the slightest bit in any direction. I only saw the light, and no other structure around it, making it impossible to be a helicopter or any other type or air vehicle or structure. We proceeded to watch the light for about 3 minutes. It remained unchanged. Then, it became a little brighter, and I noticed the color of the object was changing to a sort of bluish light. It then proceeded to move downword toward the treeline at an unusually slow, but constant speed. It seemed to move straight down without any other movement. Then, it disappeared below the treeline. After that, we went our ways, but I kept looking in that direction every few minutes. Unfortunaltely, nothing else happened that I noticed.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I quicky paid my bill and exited the building hoping to find some Anbesol in my glove box to help with the tooth ache. I got about half way to my car when I noticed that the tooth ache was subsiding. At the same time I noticed that a faint humming sound in my ear. I don't know what made me do this, but I looked up at the sky, to the northwest I believe, and noticed a tight formation of 5 aircraft. At first I dismissed them as military planes doing training maneuvers. But as I continued to watch them, they did some pretty remarkable things. The three that were closest to me (5 miles?) suddenly descended from about 25000 feet to about 500 feet.  The other 2 craft, in the rear, simply disappeared. A bright beam began to shine down from one of them. That is when I blacked out. I came to about 30 minutes later in a farm field 10 miles away. I felt refreshed. (I still had my receipt from the Waffle House in my pocket. The time on the reciept showed what time I had left the resturaunt.) What happened during that 30 minute period is beyond me. I can't remember a thing. Anyway, I found a nearby road and was luckey to find a farm house with a light on inside. The farmer gave me a ride back to my car. It was then that I noticed the my tooth was missing. The strange thing was that there was no blood. It had completely healed over as if I had never been born with a tooth there in the first place. This is what prompted me to visit your website. Looking at my arms and legs, I notice nothing unusual except that there appears to be some kind of injection mark with a lump about the size of a pea on my left bicep. It doesn't hurt and it seems hard. My vision seems a little blurred. In the back pocket of my jeans, I noticed a piece of paper that has a type of hieroglyphics. One last thing to note, the farmer said that he saw a bright light about 5 minutes before I knocked on his door. He said that it was probably lightning though. I asked him if he had heard if there was any thunder, He said no.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We were somewhat surprised to learn that there is, indeed, a Roswell, GA.

There was a long narrow object silver in color with what appeared to be windows.  However there appeared to be no wings or tail.  I would describe this as a long cigar shape. It seemed longer than most jet liner fuselages. \n\r\nI proceeded to rationalize this away thinking that I could just not see the wings. I thought that the lighting made them blend against the sky.  For that reason I did not tell my friend about it.  I looked at it for only a few minutes. \n\r\nI since have thought about it and realized that I would have seen any wings.  \n\r\nThe sun was high in the sky and I would have seen the shaded bottom of the wings not to mention the engines. Also there are two major airports near the area. So jet noise is common. \n\r\nBackground: I am 67 and retired. I spent most of my life in the retail business dealing with all kinds of people.  I was also a part time photographer and avid amateur photographer.  My hobbies also include art and bird watching.  \n\r\nI have three previous sightings but I don\u2019t look for UFO\u2019s.  I also have some other history, but don\u2019t wish to discuss that here. \n\r\nNote I wrote Filer on this also, but may have given the wrong date.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The witness apparently has had a number of sightings during his lifetime.

I can describe it best as a rotating oval with green lights around it. I at first thought it was a blimp but quickly realized that is was not anything I have ever seen before. It moved Northward at a slow rate. Slow enough I ran inside, told my friend who followed, and ran out the back door to follow its progress and was able to still see it on the way moving north. I then decided to get in the car and chase it. I turned onto Third and drove north passing Iroquois Manor. I then turned up Kingston heading toward Southern Pkwy at which time I again could see the object near Iroquois Park. I lost it behind some trees then and never saw it again.

I had been doing pretty well fishing, when I noticed a white light on the other side of the lake. I figuered it must have been another fisherman's lantern. The light appered to be moving slowly as though someone was walking with the lantern. All of a sudden I saw two bright red lights from the area where the lantern was. At first I thought who ever had the lantern was getting into their vehicle and leaving. It seemed strange (too big for a car or truck)so by this time I was entranced on the lights. They slowly moved up the side of the mountain and as it moved up it turned sidways and there it was, a cold black triangle shaped craft, the lights had become three light fading from red to amber almost pinkish. I watched the craft, which was probably 100 feet long in comparison with the background which is very familiar to me, move back down the side of the mountain and began hovering over the lake. It moved silently around skimming over the top of the lake. All of a sudden the red lights went dark and they were replaced by one very bright white light. At this time I heard the sound of something spinning, it made a wobbling sound that would speed up and slow down. This went on for sometime. I was very afraid of this thing, my hair was standing on end, there seemed to be a electrical or magnetic feild in the area, so I walked back up toward camp. I watched it for about ten more minutes, then all at once the lights and spinning sound was dead dark silence. I have had other experiances from that area if you guys are interested.

The direction of the flight was from West to East directions in the Connecticut/Massachusets state border. The object had distinctively observable 4 ligth beams (similar to high beams in the cars) alligned in rectangular format and a flashing white ligth in the center. But, it could be in a diamond format from my point of view.  The sound of the craft was very unusual for a plane or a helicopter. It almost sound it like a metal to metal rubbing with a very high pitch grinding/roaring sound. The time I observed was at 5:16 am with a clear night view in the background.  The 4 beams on the corners and the center flashing light were pointing downwards, making the area below the craft relatively brite.  The speed of the craft was steady, with a speed comparable to a slow flying helicopter.  The altidude of the craft may have been in the range of approx. 1/2 km to 1 km. The whole observation may have been in 5 to 10 seconds time frame while, the object was still visible through my window.

The object was very high, appeared shinny and reflecting sunlight. It was situated almost directly overhead. Regional latitude is 45\u00b0. The sky was clear except for the clouds created by the arial spraying, surface temps around 80\u00b0, winds calm. I set up my tripod and camera with zoom lens to 450 mm. I took several pictures of this but even with this magnification the object was still quite small. In the veiw finder I noticed a slight movement to the west. This change in position was similar to speed and direction as if watching a star at night i.e earth's rotational movement. Is it possible to see the International Space Station during a bright sunny day? If not then I'm unsure as to what this may have been. At this time the photos are still undeveloped.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Although much has been said and written about the alleged \"chemtrails,\" we continue to reserve judgment on that issue.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Left a trail, Changed Color, Aircraft nearbyF.A.A.  gives false report of UFO over Western Colorado\n\r\nat approx. 9:30 am in the morning, I was walking west along the redlands express when I observed an object moving from the South to the North at approx. 50 mph,and at an altitude of approx 8000 ft. The weather was warm and the sky was blue with no clouds or obstructions. When I first observed the object it appeared to be a small dark mass resembling a spot the size of a pencil point. However, when it reached the vincinity of Liberty cap rock formation,which is at the top of the plateau, and is approx. 7000 ft in height, the object dived down towards the ground to a height of approx. 50 ft off the ground and in so doing changed directions and shape. While desending towards the ground the object continued to move at a speed of approx. 50 mph and had no sound associated with its movement. During the decent, the object chanded from a dark mass to gray/white appearance that had no defined shape. It appeared as though it had a electromagnetic field around it that was giving off a heat signature. When it reached the ground it changed shape to a perfect sphere that was pure white and extremely brilliant that resembled the light passing through a diamond. It maintained this appearance while traveling approx. 1 mile to the South at an altitude of approx. 50 ft. off the ground. When it stopped at the one mile mark it begain to hover and in so doing changed from a bright white flashing sphere to one of a bright orange. It continued to hover approx. 50 ft. off the ground while maintaining the brilliant burnt orange color. After approx. 10 min. of hover the sphere shot straight up into the air at approx. 200 mph and stopped at an altitude of approx. 8000 ft and started hovering again while maintaining the orange appearance. At that time a jet aircraft approached from the South and appeared to narrowly miss the flying object. When the jet passed over the hovering object, the unknow craft appeared to be as large as the front of the aircraft. After the aircraft flew pass the object, the object changed back to a brillia! nt white color which started to flash as a strobe light. It then flew off to the north at approx. 100 mph while maintaining the appearance of a flashing strobe light with no discernable appearance between flashes. The next day, an article appeared in the Rocky Mountain news that the Grand Junction area had experienced problems with the Radar system operated by the F.A.A. The F.A.A. had made a public statement that their computers had experienced a glitch that had shown flying objects over the Grand Junction area that has appeared to merge with air traffic. They wrote it off as soft wear problems. The following day, a c130 aircraft flew along the cliffs where I had observed the flying sphere. It flew at approx 200 ft. off the ground and made two passes along the cliffs in a dangerous flight path. The was the first and last time that a military aircraft was observed flying in this dangerous manner at a height and speed which would never be flown in a normal operation. I have it on good authority that the F.A.A. placed the radar data on a plane and flew it to Washington the day after the so called false sighting over Grand Junction. In summary, I am a trained observer with experience from the U.S. Army ((deleted)) operations. Also, I haved worked for ((deleted--federal employment with substantial responsibility)), and served as a police officer in Ohio. What I saw was beyond the scope of our military and industrial machine. I have never reported this sighting until now. I was afraid it would damage my reputation as I had been a candidate for ((public office, Arizona)) County and wanted to seek public office.",

I was in or just out of high school and the years were between 1984-1987, (I know I was driving so probably closer to senior year of 1985), and had driven over to a friends house to hang out. We were listening to tapes and talking upstairs when the entire house began to rumble and shake. The window sills, door frames etc actually were vibrating and shaking. It sounded like a plane, low distance rumble which slowly increased.  We both ran to the window and to our amazement were shocked to see a v shaped object with wings and windows and coloered lights flying just over the tree tops of the house and development.  It had to be at least 100 feet long. Lights shot out of it hitting the ground and house. As it moved over the house we ran to the back window and looked at it.  It appeared to change shape or get smaller with long red, yellow and blue beams shining into the house windows on the first floor.  During this time my friends family had guests over and were eating in the dinning room.  We ran down the stairs to see the Dining Room flooded with these beams of colored light but no one seemed to notice us or was even aware of the lights except for my friend and I.  It was as if we were privy to see this and no one else was.  As we watched what must have seemed for awhile we noticed the lights scanned the entire inside of the home where my friends parents were entertaining.  Everyone appeared to be moving in slow motion but us. We diliberaely stayed aware from the lights.  We grabbed our car keys and ran out side to the backyard which was boardered by trees and watched as it slowing moved over the shubbery and out over some empty farmland in back.  The shape appeared to be long and rectangular but the beams of light gave it a spider like quality.  We then hoped in our car hoping to follow it, the car didn't start right away and when we got out to where we could see it again it had just head out towards NYC up into the air.  The funny part is -my friends parents didn't see anything we! re compl etely unaware of anything during the whole experience.  Needless to say, to this day my friend won't talk about it and what we saw I can not explain - just that later that summer, I and my mother were visited by a bouncing ball of blue light which slowly bounced across our backyard and then after I got back in bed appeared at my bedroom window - flooding my bedroom with an electric blue light.  My bed shock and I was paralized and unable to move unitil it left. To this day,  I do know that since I have been real little I've had experiences at seeing things and encounters up to my present age. I just don't have anyone to talk to about them or to turn to.  If anyone during 1984-1987 saw anything like this late in the evening can you please right about it.  I know this was to large for someone else not to have seen unless it was meant to happen like that.  Please note, at this point in time I would like to remain unknown.  Thank you.

The Red Light had a duratino of approximately 3 to 10 seconds, with an elevation of approximately 400-500 feet. After the red light disappeared, there was a large bright-white \"explosion \" between 50-100 feet above the original location of the red light. The \"explosion was then accompanied by a smaller flashing blue-white light, hich appeared to be flashing in a pattern. In a rural area, this light was extreamly unusual as there are no power or cellular towers in that direction and area. After observing this for about half an hour, I confirmed with the Local Municipal Airport Radar Control(Mansfield Lahm Internation Airport) that there was indead something in the sky. According to the Controler, there were four objects in that general location that were appearing on radar, but thaey were not any form of known aircraft. They appeared to him as ghost objects on the radar, but kept re-appearing, and were moving almost due North in a straight line, and were moving at an abnormally low rate of speed. After confirmation that what I was witnessing was indeed real, I started observing the lights even closer. The lights appeared top be on a translucent structure between 400-500 foot tall. THere were four red lights forming an almost perfec geometric square. After the Red light would disppear, and before the White lights would start flashing I could see the structure, it was very narrow in appearance. Approximately 20 foot wide. While the lights were not on, I could notice a \"cloud\" at the very bottom of this structure, but there was no real substance to the structure. I could see landscape behind the object, but it appeared to be distorted, or out of focus. When either of the lights would reappear, the cloud at the bottom would be gone. Also, upon closer investigation ( I Got out the binocular) The red lights appeared to be emitting a laser of some form. You could see the beam due to! the hum idity in the air. At approximately 23:00 I witnessed nine aircraft flying over the vincinity, and appeared to be in a search pattern over the unknown object. Also, I was able to write down the flashing pattern of the lights, and it appears to repeat itself. I know this sounds crazy, but I have seen unusuall lights over this area in the past, and I know I am not seeing things. I am a College Graduate (BA-Business Admin) and I am an Independant Computer Consultant, and I find this information somewhat disturbing.

It stopped again but this time,it dropped something out of the bottom of it.First out of the right side what appeared to be a white blinking object many time smaller and then about 5 seconds later a slightly larger one more towards the left side.It then proceeded to fade out slowly at first almost in some sort of sequence.Then as if someone was turning on a dimmer switch it faded back in slowly and then shut off completely.I could tell that it was quite high in the sky because there were planes flying below it during it's presentation(we have two airports in close proximity to El Cajon .

I am the Armed Response Force Team Leader at Millstone Nuclear in Waterford, CT and several of the witnesses are Armed Response Force Members and/or Licensed Nuclear Reactor Operators. From a distance of approximately one half mile, we witnessed what, at first, appeared to be a rapidly approaching plane heading toward our facility from the direction of Orient Point Long Island, NY.  This appeared as a very bright light approximately 300-400 feet above sea level, moving toward us at a high rate of speed.  The object was flying parallel to the ground at this height until it reached a distance approximately 1/4 mile from our shorline.  It then began a trajectory at approximately 60-70%, still headed in a North-Easterly direction (toward Providence, RI).  At this point, we were able to discern the outline of the object.  It was approximately 35-40' in length and shaped very much like a rocket or missile.  It had a four-fin tail end and swept back wings near the front end.  The wings extended back and outward from the body, but we could not discern the distance they extended outward. As the object began to gain altitude, there were red sparks and bluish/white smoke erupting from the rear.  Although the flight path maintained a North-East bearing, it was evident that the object was not flying in a straight-line manner once it began its' ascent.  The flight path became somewhat erratic as the object continued to gain altitude and proceded northward.  Because of the amount of contrail (which remained visible in the sky for nearly an hour) and the amount of flame being emitted, many of us were convinced the object was going to crash.  Many of the witnesses are former Naval Nuclear personnel and most thought the object was a \"Polaris-type\" missile or some other type of nautically-luanched device.  The weather conditions at the time of this incident were clear, mild, and very little wind,  The air temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit.  There were no other objects visible in the sky and the sun was just rising above the horizon to our East.  we were able to view the object for approximately ane and one-half minutes prior to it becoming indistinct. Because we are a Federally Regulated Nuclear Facility, I made immediate notification to the FAA.  The FAA made inquiries to all the airports on the North East Corridor and none reported any planes down or in trouble at the time of the sighting, however, the FAA had recieved several other phone calls conerning this incident.  The FAA called me back about an hour later and suggested I file this report.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the witnesses observed the object that was reported by the U. S. Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, CO, as a re-entering Soviet rocket shell.  Our gratitude to this witness for having taking the time and trouble to contact us, and to provide such a thorough report.  PD",

College course in physics and astronomy. 1. Sitting outside at downtown Richmond, Va. cafe; was facing north, Sun was directly over head and slightly behind; no clouds in the sky. 2. Noticed a white/silver object almost directly overhead, maybe 80 degrees north of the sun.  Looked to be a weather ballon; using triangulation with pencil-tip placed in front of my right eye, I determined without a doubt that the object was completely stationary. 3. The object remained stationary for up to ten minutes, after which, it began to move southward. 4. Over the two-minute journey out of sight, the object seemed to be rotating, or gyrating, in that it slightly changed shape (as if it were a pyramid or boomerang shape and was turning over). 5. The object proceeded in its southerly direction and passed the sun to the west... but not by much.  It was still distinctly bright, even while passing in close proximity to the sun. 6. I brought this to the attention of two women sitting nearby, who acknowledged the object.",

I was traveling in a vehicle east on 7 and it looked like a large airplane \"climbing\" gradually.I would describe it as a fat,lit cigar.  Front was dark &amp; tapered like a big, fat cigar, back orange cylindrical glow &amp; bright white trail of smoke in backwards \"S\" shape.  Time was 5:50 AM &amp; I watched it \"ascend\" slowly by until I turned onto the Dulles Greenway at Leesburg, Virginia.  Did not think anything of it really at the time.  I thought the sun was coming up &amp; hitting the smoke so that it illuminated it bright white.  It wasn't until the radio announcer on Station 94.7 FM broadcasted that the phones were ringing off the hook with people calling about what the \"white fireworks\" were in the eastern sky.  Then as I got closer to Washington, DC (time 6:15 AM)and tuned to 1500 AM on the radio that calls were coming in from all over asking them what the great white streak was in the eastern sky.  That's when I began thinking about a few peculiararities I had not thought while watching it fly over.  1) very large  2) bright white smoke &amp; the sun had not risen yet AND when it did it was orange not white  3) don't usually see orange glow at rear of plane, except what I would describe as having seen on \"rear end\" shots of the US Space Shuttle Columbia landing on the runway in Texas! 4) how'd the plane emit a backwards \"S\"  on takeoff? a plane of that size couldn't make a dip that tightly 5) the \"white smoke\" stayed around almost 45 full minutes without dissipating or expanding or thinning at all\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We suspect the witnesses observed the object that was reported by the U.

After searching and on my way to bed, I looked out my front door window which looks down the street.  I immediately noticed an exceptionally bright light 2000-3000 feet high and approximately 5 miles away.  I thought this was an aircraft, which have holding patterns over this part of Connecticut.  I continued looking because the light was so bright I wondered what type of aircraft it could be. The light was at least 20 times brighter than an aircraft's landing light. The object then starting moving up and down, mimicing an oscilliscope wave.  My binoculars were 10 feet away and I ran to get them.  Upon returning to the window and before I could get the binoculars out of the case the object moved straight up (maybe 5 degrees off of vertical) at a speed that was so incredibly fast I knew it was no aircraft.  It also left, only for a few milliseconds, a white phosphorous trail that had to be at least 10,000 feet long.  It then disappeared into the CLEAR night.",

So I know it couldn't be a star or plane and I know it wasn't a car because you can't see the road behind my neighbors house from window behind the trees. So I watched it and it started rising in a diagonal moving left.  It went behind the trees and came out into clear view. It was going faster than a plane so I didn't have to time to check it out with my telescope so I used my binoculars. It was a disk shape. The bottom of it was just a big white light but around the perimeter was a single strip of colored lights blinking on and off in a pattern. It went out of view for a second but turned around and started moving right. But it was farther away now and it went behind some trees in the distance. (not next to my neighbors) I tried to keep an eye on it but it got smaller and smaller until finally it disappeared and I never saw it come out of the other side of the trees.",

Alot of stars out, moon hadn't risen yet so was getting very dark.  While I was listening to her, all of a sudden at about 60 degrees up, I saw this bright white light.  At first I thought it was a plane that was close (because of the brilliance) but the white light kept growing to about the size of a baseball.  It grew some more but then turned bright gaseous looking green color and swelled up to the size of a basketball at arms length.  As I was looking and trying to comprehend what I was seeing, I had an awful feeling that I was watching an atom bomb explode or something, just seeing it grow like it did.  All at once, the green light died out and flickered a few times and I THINK I saw a tiny white light in it's place that all of a sudden looked like a star.  I was alone and freaked out so that was it for my UFO watching last night.  I have only seen something like this once before and that was when a rocket was sent up from nearby Wallops Island, VA that was conducting some kind of chemical test.  Barring Wallops Island having sent a rocket up last night, this was definitely something I have never seen before.  At least two other aircraft on normal local flight paths were seen right after this flare up.",

We left Alaska at 7:00am, so that by the time of the incident, it was between 10:30pm and 11:30pm. It was very slightly overcast as we were driving the highway, I could make out the outline of the mountains against the night sky. It was a mountainous area, forested. My friend was asleep as I drove. We were approximately 80 miles northwest of Ft.Nelson, on the Alaska Highway, when off to my right, hovering over a valley,between the road and the mountains, approximately a quarter mile away, I seen, what looked like, three round aluminated balls of fire hovering over the valley. The round lights looked very hot and veried in color as they pulsated and hovered over the valley. The biggest one was approximately 60ft. in diameter and was bright white, and was hovering, what looked to be approximately 150ft., over the trees. The second ball of light, what looked to be half the size of the biggest one, was directly underneath, maybe fifty feet lower. This second ball of light was bright yellowish white. Directly underneath the second ball, at an equal distance was a third round ball, again, one half the size of the one above it. This smaller round ball of light looked very reddish in color. All three round lights were pulsating very fast. It was like looking at an arc welder. I woke my friend up and we both observed this phenomena for approximately 60 seconds. I stepped on the gas in an attempt to get closer, for I could see that the road went to the right up ahead in a closer direction towards the lights. As we went around the bend, we could the lights through the trees, when they just vanished. Within ten minutes, we seen, what looked to be, a white light, 60ft long,20 ft.in diameter, round on each end, moving very slowly, against the back drop of a mountain. I stopped the vehicle and shut off the lights to observe this light. It moved very slowly, horizontally and started to pick up speed. It left a trail behind it that got duller the further back the trail went. This lighting phenomena lasted approximately twenty seconds and what looked to move about three miles, then all of a sudden, took off extremely fast and left no trail after itself, all we seen was the light traveling at an instant high speed acceleration that looked to travel the distance of maybe 10 miles, in less then two seconds.\n\n\n\n\r\n((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))\n\r\nPeter,\n\r\nThis is the reply I just got back from the other person thats now living in ((deleted)), about the report I sent him today. He had never seen the report before this.\n\r\nJust thought I'd pass it along to verify the report.\n\r\n((name deleted))\n\n\r\nHi ((name deleted))!\n\r\nI remember that incident just as plain as it happened yesterday. It is hard to beleive that was over 10 years ago.  Where has all the time gone? \n\r\nI still don't know what it could have been.  It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn't want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?  And again, maybe we will.  Anyway, it is something we can tell our grand kid's about.\n\r\n((paragraph deleted))\n\r\n((END CORRESPONDENCE))<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Emitted other objects, Aircraft nearbyFast, dull-white light multiplies and changes formation multiple time.\n\r\nWhat follows is exactly as witnessed on the night of September 8, 2001.  My wife and I were out on our balcony at our apartment complex.  We have somewhat of a limited view of the eastern sky from this vantage point due to trees, however, I was watching a distant storm cloud moving northeast. It had my attention because flashes of cloud lightning were brillantly illuminating the cloud itself.  These ended and while talking with my wife I noticed a dull white light moving at a very high rate of speed, seemingly in the cloud itself.  It's speed is what first drew my attention.  Being in Fort Worth, approximately 15 miles from DFW airport, there's quite a lot of air traffic in the area.  But this was moving faster than even low flying aircraft move in the night skies.  At first I thought the light was within the cloud itself, moving out of it.  Although now upon reflection that couldn't of been the case:  this storm cloud was much too far off to see such a light.  And indeed it wasn't behind or in the cloud.  Upon reaching the cloud's edge and emerging from it, I realized the light had the same dull white appearance as it did while seemingly in the cloud.  The light had to have been much closer to us than the storm cloud.  At that point I stood up from the rocking chair I was seated at, and moved quickly to the railing to get a better look.  At that time, the object - or light- which originally was singular became a group of three or four lights of similar hue and size.  No blinking or FAA lights could be seen.  These were not airplanes.  They continued moving in what seemed to be either a diamond or a square formation.  Then at that time, and, of course, this is what really peaked my interest, the object(s) split into a \"V\" formation.  Or, if not trully a \"V,\" then a formation shaped similar to a banana with a slight to moderate curve in it.  Following this, the object(s) distanced themselves from one another, still in the same formation, but spaced apart more.  (And I should mention at this point that e! very cha nge in formation occurred almost instantaneously.  I could see the movement, but it was faster that anything I have ever before seen in the sky.)  Still moving at what was a southeasternly direction, a single light of the same brightness, shape and size moved into the formation from ahead.  It moved into the formation seemingly at the same rate of speed as the other object(s) that were moving toward it.  This independent light joined the formation at dead center or perhaps slightly below this point.  Then the object(s) regrouped into the box or diamond formation and slowed significantly, if not stopping.  Together they rose in altitude slightly before again forming the tight \"V-banana\" formation.  At this time the object(s) were about to enter the blind spot of my balcony so I ran outside, downstairs, and around my apartment building in an attempt to gain view unobstructed by foilage.  However, because of the strong light from the rising moon and the faint, dull light of the object(s) themselves I was unable to again locate it.  And realizing the speed at which the object(s) seemed to be moving at, I knew the sighting was over.  Upon joining me downstairs, by wife did say before she lost sight of the object(s) the tight \"V-banana\" formation loosened up. Again, this occurred at approximately 00:30-00:35 hours on September 8, 2001.  The weather conditions were windy and partly cloudy with the wind and clouds moving in a northeasternly direction.  And while the sky was cloudy, an equal amount of clear, visible sky was to be seen.  The object(s) moved in a southeasternly direction which, from where I live, would put in on a crow's flight toward Arlington, Texas. I am 26 years of age, college-educated, with a degree in English.  Struggling as a writer, I spend my days earning a living as a salesman for a contracting company.  My wife is one year younger than me and is a 6th grade teacher.",

The light, about the size of Venus, appeared in the eastern sky, about 25 degrees over the horizon.  It flashed white, red, yellow and green.  As we watched, the light began bobbing up and down in variants of about 3 degrees from \"center\" position, then rapidly shifting to a similar left-right motion.  It continued doing this for at least 30 minutes.  Several planes flew near the light in a north-south direction, likely headed to SF Airport while it was in the sky - this light was far different from the plane lights.

There was a cattle grazing pasture diagonally positioned in reference to the restaurant.  With traffic coming and going, suddenly an object that greatly resembled the space craft of the day, (capsule shaped), sat down in the field slowly as fire was coming from the underneath side.  My brother and I stood in awe as we watched.  The craft sat there for what seemed to be five to ten minutes when with fire coming from underneath, it began lifting back into the air and rose several hundered feet, the abruptly turned on it's side and \"shot off\" with a great swooshing soud and left a mist type vapor in the air.

It appeared to moving by then so we got in the car and drove not far from where we were and watched we saw other objects in the sky but they seemed to be planes and didn't have the same lights and light patterns that the object did. Then we drove to a marina to see if we couldn't get a better look and we could, it was far away by then but it was still noticeable we watched for about half an hour and it stood still for a long time then it would almost zigzag again and the stand still and then do it again and then go up and down quit always and then go back to its original position when we decided to leave it was in about the same spot it was when we first saw it at the marina.

As we watched it the object began to drift to the west very slowly.  Since it was a very bright day with good thermals possible I thought the object might be some kind of debris that had been lofted into the air by a strong thermal and wind.  As we watched the object it grew a sprial tail that was at least as wide as the object itself and two to three times as long; this tail was black on one side and silver on the other.  It began to climb very rapidly with the tail spiraling in a clockwise direction.  Since it was in the local airport traffic pattern I called a report of flying junk into the ABE airport; they said they did not have anything on radar. Given the altitude and distance of the object, it must have been about 20 plus feet in length and at least six feet from top to bottom.  The cloud base was about 12 to 15 thousand feet that day and the object climbed to cloud base in less than two minutes.  I could keep visual contact as the sun reflected from the silver side of the tail. I have thought about this object nearly every day since we saw it and came to the conclusion that it was not just some kind of junk floating around for the following.  First if it was something like a cardboard box, the rectangle would have become mishapen when the tail extended as that would have been part of the box.  Second even in a boomer thermal I have never seen an object climb that fast (no whosh or whoom) it just climbed near vertical with the spiral tail flashing in the sun.  If it had climbed in a thermal, my experience is that a free flying object would circle and float not just climb like this thing did. This object is without question the most unusual thing I have ever seen. I would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has ever experienced this type of thing and if they did identify the object.",

I am writing this belated report on Sept 8th 2001.  (I will bring you all up-to-date in an other report for our more recent observations. But let me first tell you this... My wife and kids where taking a ride to go to dinner, we got on Rt 3 North from Exit 6, as was merging on to the highway I pointed out to my wife something in the sky, it looked like a star but is was moving, we then saw two fighter jets scrambling up there. This was over Plymouth Bay... I got off the highway and headed towards the bay and saw the jets again going north, so I turned around and headed up Rt 3A and thought it was all over because I am in a car not a plain so I cant chase anything.  So about 2mile I pull into the Charlie Horse Bar &amp; Grill. I pulled right up front because it look like there would be a wait, so to save time I just opened my door and looked up and WOW! No Sound, 4 Lights (3 white on each point one in the middle), Black Triangle shaped Craft Just over the oak trees aside the resraunt.  It freek me out, I stuck my head in the car and told my wife what is over us, but I did not want to scare my two kids 1 and 5 at the time.  My wife looked at me an told me \"I know....now shut (()) up!!\"  I was shocked at her attitude! She never talks like that.  I just got into the car and went to KFC and said nothing about it again to her.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

WE ALL NOTICED SOMETHING FROM A DISTANCE OF 5 OR SO MILES AWAY WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE BRIDGE.  I SAID IT MUST BE A ZEPPELIN BECAUSE OF ITS HUGE SIZE IN RELATION TO THE BRIDGE, WHICH IT APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY OVER.  \n\r\nAS WE APPROACHED THE BRIDGE, THE WHITE LIGHTS AROUND THE CENTER GIRTH OF THE OBJECT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SHIP WAS SPHERICAL AND IN SOMEWHAT OF A SUSPENDED STATE.  THE LIGHTS WERE CLEARLY OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED TYPE THAT SURROUNDED THE CENTER, AND WIDEST PART OF THE OBJECT, LIKE A STRING OF PEARLS.  \n\r\nAS WE WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE BRIDGE RAMP ALL THE PEOPLE IN EVERY CAR HAD THEIR EYES FIXED UPWARD TO THE SHIP THAT WAS JUST UP AHEAD, HOVERING. WE LATER REMARKED THAT IT WAS A WONDER NOBODY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT THAT NIGHT SINCE NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHERE THEY WERE GOING. WE WERE HONKING OUR HORNS TO GET OTHER CARS' ATTENTION AND WHEN WE DID THEY WOULD LOOK AT US WITH THE SAME TERRIFIED FACES WE PROBABLY HAD ON OURSELVES AND WE WOULD NOD TO EACH OTHER THAT SLOW KIND OF UP AND DOWN 'YES RESPONSE' THAT CLEARLY CONVEYED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND FEAR.  \n\r\nTHEN THE CENTER OF THE SHIP STARTED TO SPIN, WHICH WE COULD CLEARLY SEE BECAUSE THE RING OF LIGHTS WERE MOVING IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION.  \n\r\nAS WE DROVE CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE THE SHIP'S SIZE WAS HARD TO COMPUTE: WE COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS 100 OR 1000 FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE BUT WE KNEW IT WAS HUGE AND IT WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.  \n\r\nTHE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I FELT BECAUSE WE WERE DRIVING OFF OF THE BRIDGE, ONTO THE CLEARVIEW EXPRESSWAY AND AWAY FROM WHERE THE SHIP HAD STATIONED ITSELF, WAS QUICKLY CHANGED TO JOY AND WONDERMENT BECAUSE THE SHIP BEGAN FLYING ALONG THE SAME ROUTE, AND QUICKLY MOVED AHEAD OF US.  \n\r\nWHEN WE GOT ONTO THE LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY (LIE)THE SHIP WAS JUST IN FRONT OF US AND WAS DARTING FORWARD AND BACK! , UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY.  AT ONE POINT IT WAS JUST A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US AND WE COULD SEE HOW HUGE IT WAS: IT EASILY SPANNED THE WIDTH OF THE LIE-WHICH IS 6 LANES WIDE AND HAS A ONE-LANE WIDE DIVIDER BETWEEN THE EAST AND WEST TRAFFIC LANES AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE MAIN LANES AND A SERVICE ROAD OF 2 LANES ON EACH SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY.[13 LANES IN ALL]  IF WE HAD TO GUESS, IT WOULD BE THAT THE SHIP'S SPAN WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET AT ITS WIDEST POINT. \n\r\nTHE SHIP LITERALLY FOLLOWED THE LIE WHICH WAS HEAVILY TRAFFICKED, ESPECIALLY IN OUR DIRECTION. WE WERE ABLE TO WATCH IT UNTIL IT LITERALLY MADE A RIGHT TURN SOUTHWARD AND FLEW ABOVE THE SEAFORD-OYSTER BAY EXPRESSWAY, UNTIL IT SHOT AHEAD WITH SUCH AMAZING SPEED THAT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS A MASSIVE UFO THEN A BLIP THEN GONE. \n\r\nWE HAD CAMERAS WITH US BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE FILM, WE CALLED UP THE THEN-ACTIVE A/F BASE IN WESTHAMPTON BUT THEY DENIED SEEING ANYTHING OR THAT ANYBODY ELSE HAD CALLED WITH SUCH A SITING.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN WE CALLED THE LOCAL PAPER, NEWSDAY, THE FOLLOWING DAY.  SO, OVER TIME IT HAS BECOME A STORY WE HAVE TOLD OUR CHILDREN AND VERY FEW OTHERS BUT BOTH MY BROTHER AND I KNOW WHAT WE SAW AND ALTHOUGH OUR OTHER PASSENGERS HAVE GONE THEIR SEPARATE WAYS, I KNOW THEY TOO WILL NEVER FORGET THE EXPERIENCE.  \n\r\nI MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THE DATE BUT IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE START OF COLLEGE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AT ALBANY STATE UNIVERSITY FROM WHICH WE WERE RETURNING.

I lowered the camera and no more than 10 feet from me was a ball approximately two feet in diameter; with an outer glow that extended it to about 3 feet.  The shape was almost a perfect circle.  I did not feel any heat irradiating from the ball, yet it was burning bright red and emitting heat waves.  It remained about 20 seconds, then started to rise vertically, very slowly to about 60 feet, where it remained motionless for a short period.  It then made a 90 degree turn and then accelerated out of site.  I have a color photo of this event.  I called the police to report it and they had another report of a fire ball a block away.\n\r\n((FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REPORT:  ERIC BYLER, Oregon UFO Review, \n<oregon review@home.com=\"\" ufo=\"\">.  \n\r\nHi Peter,\n\r\nI just got back from an investigation at the coast where I got the picture you see here along with the negatives.  I am still working on the report and have to make one more follow up call with him to clarify something, but the long and short of it is that the photographer is a ((deleted)) year old man of (partial) American Indian heritage by the name of ((deleted)).  He lives alone with a rather large ((dog)) in a very nice home on the coast of Oregon in a small town named Florence.\n\r\n((He)) spends a lot of time on his yard as it looks quite good. On the day of the picture, he was out with his camera...a ((high quality SLR camera))mm  1:3.5 - 4.5...using 35mm 400 film... a very nice camera that he chooses to keep on automatic for the simplicity of pointing and shooting.  He had already made a number of pictures when he approached the plants you see in this picture.\n\r\nAccording to his testimony, as he was looking through the view finder and was about to shoot, this image appeared in his view finder.  He quickly hit the shutter button and dropped the camera to see what this was. He estimated the object as being a couple feet wide and glowing like fire with an outer lighter glow that emanated like a heat wave.  He pointed out however that as close as he was, only a few feet away, he could feel no heat.  He thought this as odd.\n\r\nAfter a few seconds, the object began to slowly rise until it reached tree level which is quite high as you can see in the picture, the whole time just watching in awe thinking, \"'what in the hell is this?\"  Then he realized, hey, take another picture.  He brought the camera up to began lining it up with the object when it did a 90 degree turn and shot away from the house traveling west towards the ocean.  He immediately took the film down to have them developed to see if he indeed had got the object on film.  I have checked out the negatives and the package with the number of pictures that were developed and is does appear that he stopped taking pictures in his yard by the time he got to the picture in question.  My thought is if this were just a reflection of some sort on the lens then it probably would have only shown up when the pictures were developed and he would have continued taking pictures.  The fact that he did indeed stop taking pictures at number ten (the roll goes backward from 24 to 1) and then developed the pictures tell me that he may have indeed seen something of a nature that points away from simple lens reflection and does add up with his story.\n\r\nI spent some time in the house with ((witness)) and I found him very easy to talk with.  ((Witness) is a big man but soft spoken.  His house is very nice with lots of reference to his heritage seen in the art work on his walls.  He has three ((medals)) permanently displayed on a side table as he was in WW2.  A wall in another room had a number of framed certificates of achievements and education showing his many accomplishments over the years.  \n\r\nIn his main den where we talked there was a large volume of books on shelves.  I saw no books pertaining to UFO material as many were related to American Indian heritage\n\r\n((Witness)) does not have a computer for internet access but does have basic television.\n\r\nHe has no idea what he saw.  He did contact the police who came over and took a report.  The following day he says he talked to the assistant fire chief while in town and he (the chief) mentioned hearing of a similar report on his scanner that day but remembers it as being on 24th street, rather than 23rd where ((witness)) lives.  I am following up on this.  I did contact the state police who reports that they have had similar reports like this over the past few months in other parts of the coast but did\r\nnot elaborate.  This is being followed up on as well.\n\r\nJust in case the photo doesn't come through, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/florence.html ... to view it.\n\n\r\nSincerely,\n\r\nEric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Our gratitude to Eric Byler, Oregon UFO Review, for the excellent investigation and follow-up review.

Just after passing the eastbound scanner and block signal at mile post 576 (10 miles north of Laramie), I looked out of the front window of the engine just to my right, and saw an orange fireball go straight up in the air, just beyond a rise in the terrain, and come right back down again. I said to my colleague, \"Did you see that!\" But he was reading, and didn't notice it. The object from where I was, looked like a baseball that had been soaked in gasoline, and set on fire. It resemebled the sun on a bright day, but with flames all around it. I would say from where I saw it, it was the size of an old school kickball. (I initially thought it was kids, but the area there is sparsely populated.) Upon proceeding with the train through the cut in the rise, about 3/4 of a mile further on, I looked back to the Northwest. I noticed what looked like a very bright, orange ball on the ground.  This would have been the correct location from where it had gone up in the air , and came back down again.  There are no houses or other structures there, just open field. I looked several more times, and the object at that time looked like a bright campfire, about the size of a baseball, as at this point, I was about 2 to 3 miles from it, and moving away. Since I saw this, I have looked over there to see if there could be a Ranch house or other structure, but there is just open range.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

We were approximately one mile out of town from Hopkinsville and had come to the end of the Concord Lane.  You had to turn either left or right onto the Greenville Road.  As we both looked to the right toward town we saw three saucer shaped craft several hunderd feet in the air and looked as if they were between a quarter to a half mile from us.  The craft had multicolored lights on the underneath side that sequentially flashed.  The sighting scared both of us of course, and I instinctively turned left and continued heading out of town. We were both looking back to see what the craft were doing and noticed they appeared to be following us.  About a quarter of a mile down the Greenville Road was a secondary road.  We turned right onto the Antioch Road and noticed that all three craft were still following us.  Approximately one to two miles out this road was a small lake.  As we started rounding the curve that bordered lake Tandy, we saw all three craft hovering above the lake and the craft in the center of the three, had flames coming from the center of it's underneath side.  I immediately turned in a driveway that was just past the curve in order to turn around.  My wife says the next thing she remembered was being back on the Concord Lane heading toward our apartment.  But I honestly don't remember anything from the point in time I turned in the drive to turn around, untill I was actually getting out of the car back at the apartment at which time we noted the time being 4:00 A.M.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

My specialty, Aircraft crewchief. My security clearance was secret. The exact date was approximately June 15,1975. The reason I say this is because the movie \"Jaws\" had just came out at Drive-ins and Theatres. I was double-dating with a friend of mine and we decided to go to the drive-in to see \"Jaws\". The Drive-in had Four Screens which were positioned North &amp; South, East &amp; West. My friends and I were waiting for the movie to start, we were facing the East Screen. The Sun was beginning to set below the Horizon which at that time the movie that was playing on the West Screen started. I had turned around in the car and was watching it when I noticed a bright object approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon, West by Southwest. I thought to myself that it was a bright star. I watched it thinking to myself that this was kind of odd because it was still light. I watched it and it began to move at a high speed from West to East. I thought I was possibly watching a SR-71 aircraft from Beale A.F.B. stationed at Marysville, CA. and it was in full afterburner and this was why it was moving so fast. At the time I knew the SR-71 was a Mach 3 Or Mach 5 acft. I told my friend ((name deleted)) to check this out. As we were watching it, it stopped suddenly and turned 90 degrees North toward us. It came straight toward us and hoverd 300 feet above and than dropped behind the Eest screen. People got out of their vehicles and watched in amazement. It raised up behind the screen to about 600 feet and traveled north at an incredible speed. No Sound!!!!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date of incident is approximate.  PD",

About 1985 I realized I my psychic abilities was getting stronger and realized that maybe this sighting was a sign to me.  About 10 p.m. in the evening my friends and I were in a hotel parking lot going to a club when we looked up in the sky and noticed with about 10 other people something zooming or shooting from very far in the sky to right over our heads - like when a plane is ready to land and you feel it is going right over your head.  This oval shaped silver aluminum looking UFO, was as it the oval was on its side with a very bright white light surrounding the whole equipment.  My concern was that I did not have my camera.  It stood over our heads for about 45 seconds with no sound - and then it zoomed extremely fast into the same spot in the sky it came from.  It did not fly - it zoomed.  A plane takes time to fly and does not stop with no noise. I believe in UFOs since that day.  I have an MBA and am an intelligent individual.  I know I am not alone - I just wish I had a camera - I could have been famous. Also, last week I saw a very large meteorite which was silver white and royal blue.  It looked like fireworks but it did not breakup until it disappeared right before it was going to hit the beach area. Till my next sighting...\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

The crafts got larger and larger.  When I was a block away from my house, one of the objects had vanished and only one remained.  It was huge.  We both got out of the car to look at it.  The object was circular and was tilted so that we could see an elliptical shape.  It was BRITE yellow-orange, and had three main lights on it.  The object had smaller lights around the craft that outlined the circular shape.  We watched it for a minute.  We herd no noise.  My house was nearby, so we then went back to my house to get my father.  I ran into my house and ran back out while my friend stayed in the car watching it.  My father wasn't home so I grabbed my sister.  My friend told me that the craft had dissapeared only moments before my sister and I had walked out the door.  It just vanished: it didn't move or anything.  The object appered to be low to the ground.

He and is two parents and a small child stopped and looked toward the sky in the SE, yet north of Mt. Rainier.  The two of us looked in the direction they were looking and saw what might be described as a falling object, very white in color, falling quickly toward the ground.  It looked almost like a Roman candle fire ball or some form of signal flare, but it was falling quickly.  No planes appeared directly in the vicinity, although 3 commercial flights were lined up for a Sea-Tac landing in the distance.  It's trajectory was not perfectly straight, nor it's speed steady.  It struck me of how a piece of plywood would fall from the sky, falling fast, then slowing and even changing it's horizontal allignment slightly as it \"caught air\".  This first object appeared to stop burning before it hit the ground (if it hit the ground)at about 25 degrees above the horizon. My partner then stated that she could see another object, dark in color, falling very fast in the sky above the first.  I could not see it with my naked eyes but she continued to watch it and tried to point it out to me.  Within 10 to 20 seconds, this object appeared to burst into flame and burn in the same manner as the first object.  It's rate of fall and trajectory was similar to the first.  This object continued to burn and possibly did hit the ground.  Our view of it was obscured by a tree in the neighborhood, but we saw it flame down to within 5 degrees or less above the horizon when it went out of view, still very bright.  We did not hear anything nor did we see any smoke or any sort of a flash when it hit the ground.  The object flamed long enough to come down west (toward us) of the Cascade foothills in the vicinity of the White River valley SE of the City of Enumclaw. We continued to watch the sky but did not see any further activity.  We could not say for sure that the planes changed their courses, but the closest did seem to stay higher than the following two.  Upon reaching our home I did try to contact the closest FAA office in Auburn and was dismissed by the operator as a nut.  She stated in broken english that they had no reports of any such activity, laughed and then hung up the phone.  We assume it must have been some sort of space junk but are curious about why it would fall for some time, then appear to \"catch fire\" and then burn until it hit the ground.",

Within 15 minutes I saw three aircraft.  Two looked the same, very far away or high up and blinking in the same manner; I assume those are the F16s patroling Colorado airspace tonight. (Due to the terrorist attacks). But the third one was strange!!  I first noticed it at the same time I saw the second F16. They were both flying in the same direction- west - nice and horizontally. The F16 was ahead.  Then all of a sudden the third craft made an abrupt upward turn and flew in a very straight line directly upwards. After about 7 to 10 seconds, it made another sharp turn eastward.  And it continued eastward until it was out of my view (about 7 seconds or so) WHATWUZZIT??!! It had a red flash of color in it but basically was just a regular white light like a plane or a star. It, too, seemed very very far away or high up, just a very small dot. I've seen falling and shooting stars, and meteors. It wasn't either of those.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We believe the witness means 12SE01.  We have amended the date.  PD",

I might not have taken notice of this except there were no planes supposed to be in the sky after the events of the day.  We initally noticed one light that was white and small, at first glance it looked like a star. It was due west. It was flashing not twinlking, one single white light then we could see three vertical lights, two white and the one in the center was red, the lights were in a row vertically.  It appeared to drop very quickly from what I assume to be a very high altitude and moved from side to side, almost insect like in it's movements. This is what raised the hairs on our necks, it was not swamp gas, a harrier jet or military planes, it's movements were like nothing I've ever seen. Ever. It continued to come down all the while flashing it's red light every so often. Finally it got to be too low in the tree line to see. Then after watching it for so long I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest, my husband and I identified this second object same as the first, it was moving in sequence with another light and another.  We made out three triangular formations in the sky comming from the north and going west. Each point of the triangle was a seperate moving and flashing entity.  Then it started to change into a circular pattern and the second light began the same descent pattern as the first.  This one appeared to be larger than the first, there was a quick white flash from it that went towards the other lights, we could tell they were headed away from us (west).  Eventually they became to small to watch and were gone.  There was no sound. Just as an after thought, at one point while watching the first light it became three lights and moved as if it went upside and back, more than once.  It was just the way it moved that set it apart from anything logical and reasonable.

Remove the top centre flat portion leaving just the edge.This transparent circular thing was becoming more visable in someplaces and hardly visable in others about it's circumference.It was kind of like the edge was rolling up and then unrolling as it paced the kids balloon.As the balloon slowly stalled and just floated higher the circular phenomenon's visability just tapered off to nothing.It was truly spooky,I would have photographed it had I the chance.

Between 02:15 AM - 02:30 AM I was driving my crappy, navy blue '91 hyundai excel on Interstate 287 North between the town of Edison and Piscataway with my friend who would also be a witness.  This part of the interstate is elevated to the point of being a small bridge and so provided us with a good view.  My approximations of distances between the ground up is based on the elevated point from which I and my friend stood. The cloud cover at this time of night was very dense and extremely low, moving at 25 to 30 mph.  The lowest clouds were only 200 to 300 yards above.  It was a very rare sight to see this type of cloud cover here in New Jersey as it is usually only seen in the more southern areas of the United States.  I commented on such nebulous formations to my friend as he too looked up into the sky.  Soon after, I noticed a large light patiently appear from out between the clouds about a 1/4 of a mile away.  I started analyzing it's most awkward arrival with extreme precision.  My thoughts and analyzations were as follows: There's a light the size of a street lamp light up in the clouds... It's a Fire Ball!!! No...it's moving too slow, it would of hit by now. The light that it's emitting is equal to that of a street lamp. Why is it floating above the lowest clouds and under the highest ones? To this I would point and yell to my friend of the unexplainable sight.  We were both frantic. But not as frantic as when the second light appeared from out of the clouds.  I pulled over immediately for us to get a better observation.  It was at this point that we could both see more than just light.  It was an actual physical object.  Very Dark Gray, slightly darker than the clouds.  Once the third light  finally exposed itself we were able to fully identify the shape of the floating object.  It was a perfect triangle.  The lights were located at the ends of each angle, but the angles were not pointed. The were rounded off. My friend and I were sobbing, crying in sheer terror, but we were more overwhelmed with happiness for we knew we were taking part in witnessing the unbelievable. Once we were both able to make full visual contact of the object we became very serious in order to obtain more visual information.  I will now become more descriptively technical so that there is no misunderstanding as to where I was positioned according to the \"object's\" location and my own. Going North on 287 we pulled over to witness the clouds come in from the North West and move South East.  The object also moved in this direction.  It moved in a straight linear axis from left to right where we were standing.  But while it was on this axis it rotated 360 degrees clockwise, patiently, without a sound.  All of a sudden the object in its immense proportions snaps into a perfect 90 degree turn and would begin to rotate instantly into a Counter Clockwise rotation North East from us.  In essence, the object's movements were perfectly geometric.  And so it was with this turn that it would make it's decent into the thickness of the low cloud cover. We could not tell of the object's full dimensions, for we witnessed it from below.  If it was the bottom of the craft that we may have been looking at then we do know for a fact that it appeared flat.  Nothing protruded from it in any way.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date of incident may be approximate, but was in April 1997.  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  PD",

It danced around and moved up and down in a triangle patern extremly fast. we watched it till 1am. When I arrived home in Henryville, IN. It was probably around a quarter til 2. My boyfriend and I went to the state forestry down the street. We took a telescope and binoculars. There we witnessed a least seven of these objects dance around and flash lights like they were talking to each other. They seemed to stay in star formations. Anytime a plane would go over they would move towards it as if watching the plane. We saw several military planes go over us. One made no noise at all. These things had flashing lights all around them almost as if they were planes. They would get bright and then dim and occasionaly move together at same speeds and movements. They made sharp turns and triangle patterns they were definately trying to stay in formation at all times. We watched two appear out of nowhere. There was a larger ship that showed up later and they all went crazy moving and flashing. There were so many someone must have seen something.

I live in Colon, MI. (85.19deg west, 41.57deg north). The time was about 22:10 when he reported to me that he saw a plane in the sky. I went to his room to see, thinking this odd as all of the airports had been shut down. I have seen airplane lights before, they strobe a a regular, even rate and have a red light on one wing, a blue light on the other and a white light amid-ship somewhere. What I saw was a slow moving craft with randomly flashing blue, red, and white lights all along the edge of the craft. We then ran outside to get a better view. It was moving due west from a point south east of my position. As it came parallel to our position I did a angle check by hand (a trick I learned in astronomy class) I found that it was about 30 degrees above the horizon over due south. I could not judge its distance as I realized that I was not dealing with just any standard aircraft, and these things could really be any size. I could not detect any sound coming from the craft. But, as I said, I have no idea how far the craft was from my position. As it neared the western horizon I noticed that the only steady lights on the craft were two white rear lights. One on each rear point. I don't know if there have been any other reports of the sighting, but I offer mine as more proof that this type of craft exists. My theory is that they may have been interested as to why there were no other aircraft in the air over one of the busiest air traffic continents on this planet.",

This event triggered my curiosity as to seeing if I could spot any other aircraft overhead as time working in the yard passed by. At approximately 2:15pm I noticed a shimmering object in the sky and instinctively went for my binoculars thinking I would see another airliner. What I focused in on was not in my opinion an airliner. It changed shape and color,and disappeared/reappeared frequently.I have no idea what its altitude was,but it was close enough to distinguish shapes and colors in the binoculars.For approx. 15 min it did not change in size or position, so it was obviously stationary.It changed from glowing metallic to a blood red fireball every 2-3 seconds, then disappeared and reappeared in its same position every 5-10 seconds.When it changed to the fireball, it seemed to look as if the fireball was surrounded by a black ring.(I know it sounds like an afterburner from an f-15 but jet fighters move quickly and this stayed in place for 15 min. with no change in size or position.)No audible sound was heard. In the process of setting up a telescope to get a closer look, I asked my wife if she would keep an eye on it but it disappeared before I could get a focus on it with the telescope. My connection at Newark Airport informed me there were no other flights in the area at that time. If anyone else saw a similar event at or near this time, please post it. I know I'm not the only one who has been looking up since 9/11/01.",

The weird thing was that it wasn't moving and it definately had a strange light pattern. My husband brought out his telescope and managed to get it in the sights. There was a bright white light and seemingly colored lights (red, blue, green) appeared to swirl around the white light. The craft was completely stationary from what we could tell.  It did eventually move further west very very gradually. An airplane of some sort (seemed like a commercial airliner) did fly from east to west directly over the craft.  The reason my interest was piqued at all was that a friend told me she saw a ufo the night before in the Duvall sky so I was keeping an eye out for anything unusual.  My husband, who's very skeptical, even seemed to think that the craft was something highly unusual. Not your normal airplane definately.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We would like to know whether the object disappeared from sight after the 15 minutes of observation indicated by the witness.

We were standing on my private road in a dark section of my property, and kind-of pointing out various constellations. I live in a rural section of the mountain/desert areas north of L.A. It was a totally clear night, maybe one or two extremely small bits of cirrostratus cloud, hardly bigger than your finger on an extented arm. There was a small amount of scattered light from the urban areas to the south, but not too much. There was no moon, and the air was pleasant, about 70 degrees. I, and the others, happened to be looking over the mountains to the SE (Mt. Gleason) and there we saw what appeared to be a comet, low on the horizon. I was watching it for about 5-10 seconds, and I said to Anthony, \"Is that the comet you're gonna look at when you set your scope up?\" He was looking, too, and he said, \"There's no comet supposed to be there this early in the year,\" Well, as we look at it, it gets MUCH brighter, and suddenly seems to surge toward us, passing either into or behind a small cirrostratus wisp of cloud, which lit-up interactively. It continued in a NW direction, very quick, accelerating much faster and glowing much brighter than any plane or chopper. It now appeared to be much lower and closer, maybe 20,000-40,000 feet altitude, somewhere over the San Gabriel Valley. It was approxamately 40 degrees above the horizon. Suddenly it came to an abrupt stop, and just as suddenly shot off to the north for about 2 seconds, it's sky track paralleling the horizon and covering about the width of your hand with your arm extended out front. Another sudden stop. Another abrupt course shift, back toward us, heading NW. No regular aircraft could withstand the G-force required of such instantaneous manuevers. It then shot hard to the west for another 2 seconds, stopped instantly, glowed incredibly bright, and shot straight up, fading to nothing in about 1.5 seconds. I remember saying, \"It's clearly exhibiting some non-ballistic movements.\" It was quite evident this was a strange craft. It glowed like a bright star, with a hint of changing color around the edges. It really didn't have a shape, per se, but for a star, it did appear... thick, or fat. The star's disk was bigger than Jupiter on a good night. It also appeared to briefly leave a very faint trail, which disappeared within1/4 second from being laid down, almost making it's movements look the way pionts of light used to look as seen by old Vidicon tube video cameras with their slight, brief trails.",

I was driving, while my boyfriend hung out the window-- staring at what he knew was not a terrestrial spacecraft.  Describing it, he still hesitates in his own amazement.  \"It was the length of a football field, and width of two jumbo-jet planes, but it had no wings.  Moving in complete silence, it must have traveled up to thousanth's in the mile while heading downward, and then haulting to a hovering pace.\" Estimating we were driving at about 70 mi/hr--braking to about 60; the spacecraft must have slowed to a mere 40-45 mi/hr. It came about about 1/25 a mile away from my boyfriend.  Seeing it face-foward, he described a large window, defining it as more of an entrance, possibly, than an outlook.  The lights were of a variety. Seeing blue, red, yellow, orange, and white, they stood solid, with no flickers or blinks. We proceeded to travel west and looking back notice the object hovered above a tree and house. Emitting a bright triangular like shroud of light in the dark of night, giving us the ability to see the tree and house from our distance. Demonstrating an output of what seemed to be an unending power. THIS WE HAD SEEN TOGETHER, IT IS TRUE...

I was about ten miles out of Lafayette In. traveling twords my exit. I noticed an object in the sky at this point to my left. The highway is very dark, it was nine at night, and there are NO street lights lining the road. I first noticed the red \"globe\" of light in the middle of the object as I approached it. The object was floating VERY close to the road and quite low. It was on the other side, (North bound lanes) of traffic so I had to look across to see it. At this point I am still approaching it and think it is a red light on a tower of somesort, then I start to become horizontally in line with it as I pass, I look ,and as soon as I saw the 5 or so red flashing lights on the bottom of the craft that were flashing on and off slowly I knew what I thought I was seeing. I had a very good view of the object At this point, and so did others in the northbound lanes because I remember every car that approached the scene started braking. The object itself was about 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air and I just stared in awe. What I saw was a craft that was very dome like in appearence, the thing that was most odd was how this dome that made up 80% of the object was transparant this is how I could see the red light that never flashed in the middle. The red lights around the bottom were the same size as the one in the middle, and they appered to be attached to the saucer bottom part of the craft that the dome sat on. These lights flashed in unison at intervals of about 2 seconds. It was just like I saw on tv, it was like a movie was being played in front of me in the sky, I couldn't believe how fictonally sterotipical this UFO looked. I passed the object, kept staring and followed it until I was out of sight of it. I never saw the object zoom off, it really just hovered slightly as I was passing it anyway, no supersonic blastaways. I rac! ed to ca tch up to my girlfreind who was in my truck who was about 1/2 a mile in front of me, all she had noticed was the people braking, not the object though. I am most curious to see if anyone else that night has seen this. SOMEONE had to have, it was right by the road, I mean right next to it over the bean field. It was a very clear night I noticed the stars as I looked into the sky all the way home.",

The light was at least 5000 feet minimum, and the red color was of a quality i've not seen before. There was no strobing etc., just a solid red that was very vivid and unlike any conventional aircraft lighting i've seen. We had pulled over to establish if the light was stationary and it was. I could say with confidence this wasn't a star because it vanished after we drove out of tree cover. We watched this light for approximately 10 minutes. I have submitted this report based on the report given on jeff rense 9/11, even though i wasnt going to report this, in light of other reports i thought it would be helpful since the first thought is military based on current events and we witnessed this light on 8/26.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  The planet, Mars, would be in the southwest sky at 2230 hrs., and it would appear to be red in color.

From about 2100 hours we watched a tight group (seemingly on a single object) of three colored lights remain roughly stationary for about 3 hours (when we stopped checking) in the sky (about 10 oclock high) to the North-East (visible from SE Seattle, from ridge above south end of Lk. Washington). The colors were a distinct green, red and white.  They moved just slightly, relative to each other, indicating some small movement, but over the period of viewing, the object stayed basically stationary in what was seemingly a hover pattern from our distance (up close, maybe a tight circle?).  We were interested in particular due to the total grounding of all civilian aircraft that night.  The size of the lights and intensity was about right for a planet, but the lack of move over time ended that thought for us (as well as the sharply varying colors). I would be very interested to find out what this was...I ended up guessing a military object of some kind doing some sort of surveillance in light of the NY City attack...but, the stationary nature of the object and duration of presence confounded me.

The hotel balcony is only about 300 feet from the ocean.  I first noticed a disk shaped object hovering what appeared to be 30-40 feet above the beach.  At first I thought this was a seagull sized bird flying in place against the ocean breeze.  This seemed unlikely, since it was 11:15pm and the wind was barely blowing.  My next thought was that this faintly outlined disk shaped object could be a kite.  The object was bobbing and moving like a kite would from my vantage point.  5 seconds later this object moved to my right about 10 degrees behind a palm tree and shortly thereafter re-appeared to the right of the tree.  This convinced me that this was not a kite since the object moved too fast and started to ascend slightly.  The object continued moving in a slightly ascending trajectory to the West (my right)  This movement covered roughly an additional 20 degrees.  Somewhere near this phase of the sighting, the object emmitted a dim red/orange continuous glow, and that's what I tracked for the remainder of the sighting.  As the object moved across the sky to the right, it suddenly reversed directions and started moving East in a relatively straight line. Now I knew that this was like nothing I had ever seen in my life.  The object then moved in a counter clockwise circular motion, followed by another pass from left to right. Finally the dim light stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up and slightly to my right.  After this point, the light became dimmer and dimmer in the black moonless sky.  I called my wife out to see, but she could not pick up the very faint light at this point, roughly 45 degrees off the horizon.  This episode lasted 30-45 seconds.  The next morning I repositioned myself on the balcony in order to guesstimate how far away this object was.  Clearly, the object. depending on it's size, was between 1/8 and 1/4 mile away at the early stages of the sighting. (Well below the horizon) This would make the object size about 20-30 feet across.  I am college educated, and I know what airplanes, helecopters, sattelites, and shooting stars all look like in the night sky.  I did not hear anything; my encounter was only visual.  All these signs tell me that this object was definitely out of this world.  Needless so say, I could not fall asleep for several hours.",

I set down my lunch box and water bottle leaned up aginst a pole pulled out a cig and fired it up. I noticed the sky was really clear probably due to a small cold front. I was looking south up at some stars when they started moving. I could not see the body of the craft due to the darkness but there were lights on the thing witch twinkled like stars in the shape of a V . I couldnt believe what i was seeing i took a few steps forward or tord the craft whitch was about 100yrds away the craft was moving south not too fast at first then the next thing i know the lights on the craft kinda fade out leaving behind it the blackness of the night sky!",

Then at a very high speed turn south coming my way. Then i notice it wasn't just one big light flashing as it got closer. there was at least four lights almost flashing at same time. The lights where..not really white,They just didn't look like lights from a airplane. At this point i stop the car, and got out to get a really good look at it.Before it got right about me,i notice the lights on the bottom of it was like a blacklight color'purple,or a blueish color'if you know what i mean. My car was still running and i had the radio on, the radio went out, and my car almost died ,At this time it picked up speed and took off out view to the southeast.The one thing the gets me, there was no sound, nothing from it,or bugs..I live in florida theres a ton of bugs that make alot of noise at night.I didn't notice this til i was going to leave. funny thing is,when i was getting in to my car there was three other cars pulled off the road watching it. We all talked about it for a bit ,before we left .One of the guys took a pics of this, I'm trying to get a hold of him for a copy of the pics, I just hope they come out good. just in case i drew somes pics of it i can send in.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

I was changing the price signs on the gas pumps at the travel center where I work in Woodward Oklahoma. As I was taking down the old signs, something caught my eye in the sky. I looked to see a huge silvery triangle traveling at an impossibly fast speed going from west to east. It stopped in mid-air, without slowing, became invisible for a couple seconds, then sped off west. It stopped, again- mid-air, without slowing, then dropped straight down out of the sky then became invisible once more. Following this, I heard a very loud sonic boom and heard the roar of a jet, but did not see a jet. A short time after that, I heard two more sonic booms.

I'm not a 100% believer, but simply that it's possible.  Now that I've qualified myself so you all don't think I'm a nut.;) On the evening of Sunday, 9/16 at about 6pm I was on my back patio picking up messages from my cell phone.  As I was listening to messages I heard planes going overhead, the planes caught my attention considering the WTC bombing occurred earlier in the week and I was surprised to hear the planes in the air.  As I was watching a plane go over I noticed an object far beyond/above the plane that caught my eye.  The object was a little South East of me.  I live about 10 miles from NYC and I would guess the object was in that area.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes, it didn't move. I then pointed it out to my 60 yr old neighbor; he went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I focused on the object for a few short minutes:  it was a soft tri-angle shape, almost a teardrop shape, and it was metallic in color.  As I was watching the object it disappeared.  I asked my neighbor if he saw that and he said it shot/flashed to the north...it was a streak/zip that left a short blurred trail behind it .  We discussed what we saw and thought it was maybe a weather balloon, but thinking more on it we didn't think it could be because it remained in one place for at least 10-15 minutes, and then it shot quickly in the opposite direction that the wind blew.  Further, the shape wasn't right either.  It looked like the shape of an upside-down balloon, but a little sharper on the edges.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous, but he describes himself as someone with a strong technical background.

A vehicle streaming two contrails from the direction of 335-345 degrees true overflew Seattle/Issaquah, WA area.  Made a high speed, 180 U-turn directly overhead and departed area at very high speed.  Estimate altitude at 35,000 feet.  Diameter of turn estimated at 2.5 miles.  Time from directly overhead to beyond visible horizon heading toward NWest approximately 25 seconds.  Vehicle was audible entire time, but shape of vehicle could not be discerned due to altitude.  Sun still up, but dusk approaching.  Very loud noise consistent with un-hushed military jet engines.

At first they were all in one row, then they went to a box formation and then to a triangle.   They reverted back and forth between the box and triangle.  When in the triangle formation, the fourth object was off to the right of the triangle.Then the fourth came from the west to the east at a tremendous speed without sound and disappeared out of sight. Now there were three left. About five min later one more flew by in the same manner.  When we looked back to the triangle, one was at 12:00 and the other was at 6:00 and at this time the third one also went from the east to the west at a speed I did not know existed. It stopped and went north the other two just stayed in the same place except they slowly gained altitude till they were out of sight. It appeared that the objects were yellow/orange in color though that may have been a reflection of the sun. They were too far away to determine any shape.  I am a devotee of aircraft; historic and modern.  One of the persons with me is a pilot and could not understand what was happening. Another was a schoolteacher, and two are neighbors.  I called SFO airport,the FAA and channel 7 news. No one knew anything. This is the first time that I have seen anything like that.

I looked up again, and after a few more secs the craft moved northeast and disappeared in about 1 sec or the same time it took me to turn my head and see it disappear from my sight.Right about then the light turned green.

T\u00f8gersen says several more people have come forward after news reports carried the account of three people in the town of Mosj\u00f8en who dove for cover when they saw a low-flying, whirling object hurtle through the night skies On September 23.  \"We also have several other witness observations of the same phenomenon in the same time frame on Sunday,\" T\u00f8gersen said.  Other people have reported sightings of additional UFOs that apparently resemble small, brightly lit balls.  While the larger object over Mosj\u00f8en emitted no noise whatsoever, T\u00f8gersen says the smaller objects are reported to have made a hissing sound.  But the most remarkable reports came from the northern city of Bod\u00f8.  There, a woman went out of her house and a flying object landed on her lawn, stoo!\r\nd there awhile, and then lifted off and flew away.  Two other separate individuals reported the same sighting, at the same time, on Saturday evening.  One of the two was driving his car when he spotted it flying over Vefsnfjorden, while another saw it while out on a veranda.  Both reported that it was brightly lit.

They experienced the situation as threatening.\n\r\nThere was no sound. What originally looked like a helicopter was completely silent. After looking like it would crash it changed direction and flew out the Vefsn fjord and disappeared. As the witnesses thought it had crashed in the fjord they went to the police to report an accident.

There was a nice light breeze and thin clouds with spaces between them were continuously rolling over the mountain range out to the east. The moon was approx 1/4 and out to the south west about 30-40 degrees, with clouds obscuring it sometimes. Observer 1 noticed an object directly upward which at first glance could be mistaken for a bright star, only he said it was moving. He pointed it out to us, and myself(observer 2) and observer 3 also could see it moving, almost fluttering around much like a bee, kind of bouncing ever so slightly. We kept watching it and started noticing there were many more overhead that were moving around too. They all appeared as stars at first, some more intense in light than the others. The light was constant, not blinking, but fading in and out. Observer 3 said he saw a blue light coming from one of them, changing back and forth from blue to white occasionaly. I personally noticed about 3 or 4 of these things moving, dancing on the edges of the clouds, almost trying to hide themselves with the moving clouds. They never went too far from their apparent location in the sky, but appeared to all of us that they were rapidly changing up and down in altitude at times, the light would sometimes be diffused by the clouds. We called my mom out, observer 4 to take a look. She said she could see them moving around too. Remember, this is just my account of this eyewitness, and I may have forgotten a few things, as I am writing this 24 hours after the sighting. Nevertheless, it is still very freshly ingrained in my mind. I am going to encourage the others to post their accounts of this on this website too. Just after observer 4 saw these objects, observer 3 decided to go home. Us 3 kept watching the skies, and woke my dad up to come see at approx 9:30. He looked for a just a few minutes and didn't seem to interested or convinced and went back inside and went to ! bed. Us 3 kept watching, myself and observer 3 lied down on the benches on the deck so we could see straight up. There seemed to be more and more of them appearing out of nowhere, fluttering around the clouds, which were diminishing and the skies gradually getting clearer. When all of a sudden, 2 seconds of sheer terror and astonishment at the same time. A triangular shaped, HUGE OBJECT, darts across the sky, seeming to be relatively low in elevation, and MASSIVE in size. It was almost like a shadow, an ominous bird taking up a good portion of our view. It could have been a very tight formation of several craft, or just one HUGE one. I thought I saw maybe nine arrow like faint lights or reflections of city lights below all pointing forward, almost like a formation jets fly in. We yelled out because this thing was flat out the fastest thing I have ever seen in my life. It covered the portion of the sky visible to us in those one to at most two seconds we saw it. Not only that but perhaps the biggest thing too. It was probably only in view for only 1-2 seconds. All of us saw it, and realized we had shrieked out in amazement, saying what the hell was that!!!!!!!!!! I can't begin to tell you what kind of feeling came across me, and us. Goosebumps and heart racing. It was so stealthy, appearing kind of neutral in color, not dark and not light, almost transparent, but blocking the background above it. It was going due South, DIRECTLY over us. Observer 3 said it reminded her of a huge Thunderbird. It appeared to be about only a couple thousand feet up, and about as big as my hand when held as far away as possible. As we gathered ourselves and asked eachother about it, while still looking up, another one flew over, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after the first one. We all briefly screamed again, because we were excited about seeing the first one, and something that moves that fast is supposed to scare you!! We are ALL CERTAIN we saw the same thing. This one didn't appear as large, but going just as fast, who could estimate the ! speed of these things, but I would say several thousand miles an hour, that fast!!!!!!!! IMPRESSIVE.... At this point we were wonderin what the hell was going on, almost like being in a dream, where you can't believe your eyes. But it's real and you know it. We live on the outskirts of town where many people have animals, and we heard dogs barking, horses and donkeys beying, pet geese making all kinds of noise. The second (relative to the size) also appeared to be flying low, maybe half as large as the first one that flew directly overhead, north to south just as the first. They made NO noise whatsoever, and left no trails, only in view for an instant. They appeared to be going straight and at a constant velocity, real damn fast. How could this be happening? Are they ours? I don't see how they could be, given the apparent size and speed. But you never know. All the while, these star looking lights, that were moving around, almost confined to an area, started to have more activity. We witnessed several of them shoot across the sky over the next hour or so, almost like meteor trals, but the trails much much longer then a meteorite's, but not seeing that ominous \"big bird\" again. Observer 1 was freaking out a little, and decided to go inside to sleep. Myself and observer 3 stayed outside, waiting and watching when whizzzzzzzzz Two light colored objects about 70 degrees up to the east of us, coming out of the North again, going south, were two light colored Diamand shaped craft, resembling big planes with only wings and no tail or fuseloge, whizzed across the sky with the same breakneck speed, then the were gone, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Where are they going? Back to Nevada or New Mexico? Or better question, where are the coming from? We might never know. But we have to believe, anyone looking in the Pueblo skies that night HAD to have seen it too, just too much activity, too many things moving, and the flyovers, those were enormous crafts, too big to miss, but maybe too fast for someone to see if n! ot looki ng up at all times. This had started at about 9:00 pm and at midnight, still happening. I think I had seen some sort of UFO sighting about 12 years ago, but it was nothing as convincing and REAL and fast and awesome as this. So us two keep looking at the skies and noticed a formation of flickering lights off to the east about 30-40 degrees up. It looked like a mini little dipper constellation, only the objects were dancing around this look alike formation, way to small to be the little dipper. We kept watching this because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The objects seemed to be about 2-3 times the width in length, appeared bluish white in light, and danced and tumbled around almost like a school of fish. We were getting tired and weary and decided to go to sleep. That's it. Hope to see them again, next time I will have my camcorder on a tripod, recording constantly looking straight up. I didn't have it at the time of the sighting and no pictures were taken. This eyewitness was just too eery and too scary not to report, I'm sure some people will think I'm crazy, but 4 people can't see the same thing and it not be real. Besides, I'm almost certain that other people in the Pueblo area had to see it and will hopefully report this as well.",

We observed this 5 times before the lights disappeared.  These lights seemed quite low to the horizon and yet we could hear no noise such as you might from a plane.  The other odd thing was that during this time we noticed a very strong and overwhelming manure type odor.  Since this area is near a cattle farm that would not be unusual, except there was no breeze that night and this odor appeared very suddenly, lasted several minutes and then just went away.",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Aircraft nearbyEight  objects seen within 10 minutes in broad daylight.\n\r\nThe morning was warm with absolutely clear skys and no wind.  A group of six of us were gathered after church at one of their homes.  Four of us had stepped out into the back yard to smoke (cigarettes).  I was watching an airliner fly through the sky about 1000 Ft or more in altitude and noticed a bright/shiney round object sitting what appeared to be stationary well above and N.W. of the passenger jet.  I asked the others what they thought it could be and asked for some binoculars to view it better.  Most said that it must be a balloon.  It was to hard to see clearly what it was even through the binoculars.  It did look circular in shape.  Several of us took turns with the binocs. to see if we could make out what it was.  It remained stationary the whole time we watched it, not moving up, down or horizontally.  As one of the others was looking through the binocs. I began to scan the sky and saw another airliner heading North at what appeared to be a normal flying altitude of maybe 2000 Ft. plus.  Then all of a sudden I noticed a formation of seven Bright/shiney oval objects as large as the airliner, flying South far above the airliner.  These objects had a bright sheen to them, almost like a \"halo\" around them.  Again I brought this to everyones attention and most dismissed these as military aircraft doing manuvers, geese or something else.  The odd thing about this formation was it looked like a lower case \"y\" flying sideways, tail first and that at the altitude these were flying they were still as large as the airliner.  Also noteably peculiar was that three of these craft rotated/changed positions in the formation with relative ease.  That is to say that they dropped out of formation, dropped back behind the others, then moved to their new position with ease.  Very fluid and quick  movements, which seems a strange ability considering their size.  Their rate of speed was no faster than normal airliners as a formation.  After the formation left our view I returned my attention to the area where we ob! served t he \"balloon\" and it was no longer in view.  The whole time this transpired was no more than 10 minutes.  Our group consisted of various ages and backgrounds.  As for me, I am prior military, 44 years old, and definately keeping a closer watch on our skys.  These are not the first peculiar aircraft I have sighted or reported.  I am one that tends not to speculate to much as to where these unusual craft come from.  I believe they are made by \"man\" until proven otherwise.  Just seems strange that with all these different objects flying around, how is it that the \"men\" who makes them or flys them hasn't bragged about it or \"let the cat out of the bag\" so to speak?",

The moon was slightly obscured by scattered clouds, but there seemed to be a straight line of clouds just above the moon, and than above that open sky.  I just happened to look away and than look back at the moon.  5 or 6 lights, dots, red bluish, whites light in the form of a boomerang, or wing, with what appeared to be 3 or 4 dots/lights on one side (east) and 1, possibly 2 on the right hand side (west side).  What I thought odd was how fast, smooth and how they moved without loosing their altitude or grouping.   The dots did not disappear behind the cloud; rather they disappeared into the sky. My watch read 22:00hrs MST. I am not much of a stargazer, but this did catch my attention.  The dots seemed to come from the north or above me very quickly, but clearly, very clearly.",

Just above the mall looking north, I couldn't help not to have seen, what took my attention by the extreme brightness of intensity. My estimation is that this would have been located more directly above the Nellis Airforce Base by my judging it. Looked very simular to a satellite burning upon hitting the atmosphere but like i said, brightly burning with a blue color and tail. Happened very fast and there was no sound or smoke. Never heard any reports or news as well. My reason to report this is the variation of how this burning object was unlike other types of instances I have seen from meteors, burning satellites, and comets encountered. Possible that the close proximity was a factor but where did it hit? Never heard news of it since? while I am here I would like to mention that Las Vegas, NV is the brightest city seen on the planet earth and looks as though where a star on the planets surface. If our telescopes where to see a star on the the surface of Mars, it would be a phenomena of amazing proportion. IS LAS VEGAS SOME TYPE OF BEACON TO THE SKY??? TRY TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS.  thanks",

One was red, one was blue, one was yellow - the primary colors.  The craft zigged and stopped at an awkward angle at a higher altitude.  This happened one more time, then it just sorta faded away - disappeared.  It didnt shoot off, it faded like pulled a cloak over itself.  I tried chasing it, but, it didnt work.  I noticed some bright lights in the distance, East I believe.  I went to check them out and got as close as I could (in my car) and saw that they were six apache helicopters.  I know they were apache helicopters because of my military training.  The choppers wouldnt let me get close, they would veer away.  As I watched, they seemed to be searching the fields for something.  Earlier that night I was in the country looking at the sky and noticed what looked like stars zigging and zagging about the sky.  Definitely not any sort of commercial aircraft.  I have some friends who have also witnessed such a craft, but, had never told anyone until I told what happened to me.  They too said it had first been noticed at the graveyard.  Human or extraterrestrial I do not know.  What I do know is that this is real.  The triangle, the apache's, the zig zagging stars - Oh and I almost forgot, my kick ass car stereo all of the sudden wouldnt pick up any stations, are all real.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous.

One yellow ball exactly one week later@around the same time of day\n\r\nThere were accually two events that occured in one week. I am not sure of the exact month, but I remember it being warm enough to go with out a coat. Both sightings happend on a Thursday and both occured at around dusk. I was in high school at the time. On the first sighting two of my friends and myself were standing on Owen Hill Rd. near the four corners of the small town of Killawog, looking south. From up over a hill to the south, maybe a mile and a half in distance, I saw a bright yellow light. I pointed it out to my two friends and as you can imagine, the three of us were mystified. I could not tell whether or not it was just a ball of light or if it was a light attached to something. The light was too bright for me to clearly see if there was a shape behind it. It was flying somewhat towards us. Mainly north-west, us being to the north. It passed over a hill to the west, out of our view. It was in our view for about 30-45 sec. Within 10 sec. of the first yellow light leaving our sight, a second ball of light came of the hill to the south from the same location as the yellow one. This one was much different. It was bright red and at least 3 times as large as the yellow one. It flew in the same exact path that the first one did, and disapeared from our view over to same location on the hill to the west. The third and final ball of light came exactly as the previous 2 had gone. the third ball was the exact same size and color as the first one. My friends and I waited where we were for about a half an hour. Partly to see if there were anymore, but mainly to listen for engine sounds. We heard none. The balls of light were definatly not traveling fast enoughto break the sound barrier. At first we all thought that they were helecopters, but we quickly relized that if they were we would have heard them. The next encounter I had was exactly a week later at roughly the same time. This time I had a different friend with me. I had told him about it and he just laughed at me. That night (dusk) we were in the ! yard of a residence a few hundred yards from where my other two friends and I had been a week prior. There is a hill that is fairly tall and has a very steep incline roughly 50 yards behind this residence. I again was to first to see it. It was coming over the hill behind the house to the south. From the south to the north. I quickly pointed it out to my friend saying \" See!I told I wasn't lying!\" As soon as my friend turned to look it appeared that the craft had turned 180' heading back in the direction it had come from.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>The date is approximate.

            "characteristics": "Changed ColoA couple of friends, my wife and I were staying in Albuquerque (87104) at the Sheraton Old Town hotel on September 21, 2001.  We were sitting by the outdoor pool chatting, between 20:00 - 20:30.  We all saw bright chrome like, circular (somewhat elongated in direction or flight) object pass overhead at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound or sonic blast, so we assume it was traveling slower than the speed of sound.  Since it did not pass through any clouds, we assumed that it was below them, perhaps a few thousand feet above us.  It had no lights, although it changed colors from red to lavender to silver as it streaked across the sky.  It appeared like the sunset was reflecting off of it, but sun had set around 19:00.  There was no visible exhaust, flames, or vapor trail.  We first observed it almost directly overhead.  It was moving in a WWN (290 degrees) direction.  It was only visible for a few seconds, since it was traveling at a high rate of speed; much faster than a commercial airline.  Its relative size would be equivalent to looking at an object the size of a dime held at arms length over ones head.  Since we had no explanation for what we saw, we assumed it would be explained as a weather balloon. However it did not look anything like a weather balloon and it traveled in a straight line and did not appear to gain altitude.  I am a retired automotive executive with a master's degree in engineering. My wife and I have been married for 39 years and have never seen anything like this before. Our friends have been married for 40 years and he is also a retired engineer. In addition, I am an amateur astronomer, so I have some knowledge in identifying objects in the sky, such as meteors.  Can you help explain what we saw?",

I was just sitting there to show my presence to show her boyfriend that I still liked his company even though their relationship of two years had recently broken up and had left everyone concerned,not knowing exactly how to address each other now!

It was headed at a normal aircraft pace to the place that the bright light was hovering. The light from the south sky approached the position where the brilliant light was and it moved straight up as if the jet(I'm thinking) passed it by.\n\r\nThen a jet with lights blinkiing like an emergency vehicle and headed towards the bright light flew from what I surmise as around Wright Patterson field, which is close to where I live,at a \"bat outa hell\" pace and sped off toward the position of the light that is still in my vision over the power line in my back yard.

My wife observed the object 30 degrees above the horizon to the NNW first going level and then instantly changing course downward at a 30 degree angle until it disappeared at the tree line.  I saw the object (apparently) after the course change, and it took a couple of seconds to go from an elevation of 30 degrees to the tree line.  My wife describes the object as a \"yellow orange glowing object.\"  My description is of a sliver, not bright, yellow orange, which was sort of pinched at either end.  Frankly, it looked a little like the illuminated passenger cabin of an airliner.  However, at the angle and location in question, and considering the high speed of the object, it was not an airliner unless it crashed.  I opened the sunroof and listened for sirens---nothing.

I was toweling off when a fast moving 'golden flash' caught my eye.  I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects flying through the sky coming towards my North Phoenix home (trajectory was southwest headed northeast). However, the objects flew on a heading to the northwest. As the objects flew past my home, I saw a third light (object?), also golden.\n\r\nThe objects resembled chaffe or flares, but they were not falling.  They were moving horizontally and at an extremely fast clip..  They appeared to be flying in a very tight bunch. I expected the objects to fall towards the earth, but they elevated at that time.  I then went inside to see if any explosions had been reported in the area.  I checked the net &amp; televised news.  Nothing at this time.\n\r\nImmediate thoughts: Shooting stars (much too close to the ground), asteroids/space debris...errant missles from an F-16 (Luke Air Force Base is located in the direction that the objects came from, approx. 15 miles from my home). I must point out that I've seen F-16's at night and during the day. A friend used to work on them at Luke. The objects were in no way near the size of an F-16.\n\r\nAt no time did I see traditional form to the matter that passed by. No wings, smoke or trailing airstreams. However, the objects were moving so fast that the gold color trailed. One other peculiarity, there was no sound at all. I live in a sleepy residential area and at 1:05 AM, I should have heard something from objects so close to the ground. Believe me, I am 42 and have never seen anything like this.  I have never seen a UFO, nor do I feel that I saw one (classical sense) tonight.  What I did see was something extraordinary.",

As I was looking toward the south I saw what appeared to be a grouping of helium balloons that some child must have lost. However, as I began to track this object across the sky it became apparent that my first impression was wrong. The object definitely appeared to be at a higher altitude than any normal helium balloon that a child would have released might be. At this point I brought this object to the attention of my father who it an experienced meteorological technician. He has worked for the Department of Commerce as part of the National Weather Service for almost 40 years. He tracks weather balloons almost every day. Taking that into consideration I assumed that he would have a theory as to what this object might be. We retrieved binoculars from our house so we could take a closer look at this object. On closer inspection of the object it appeared to have balloons at the top supporting a black triangular shape at the bottom. The balloons also seemed to be illuminated by a very dim light. The strange thing about this object was the balloons did not appear to be big enough or strong enough to support such a large object. We also confirmed that this was not a weather balloon. As I mentioned previously my father, who is an experienced weather observer, observed this object as I did and he was absolutely positive that it was not a weather balloon. We watched this object track to the southwest at a steady pace at about 20-30 knots. It appeared to be at an altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet. It did not appear to descend or climb at all during the 20 min. we observed this object. We were both very perplexed and had no theory as to what this object might have been. After my father, a person who has observed the skies for 40 years, had no theory as to what this object might have been I considered worth reporting.",

We had been driving out of the LA area on I-5 north and entering the little mountainous section leading into the Angeles National Forrest Area and Pyrmaid lake area.  The time was just before dark when I had been starring out the window and noticed that toward the coast there was someting in the air which wasn't very normal.  It seemed to be in the shape of some sort of missile and was on a very subtle donward trajectory.  It was very obviously not a plane and my husband who is an engineer also agreed that it wasn't a plane and also thought it kind of looked like a missile.  I have to admit that it freaked me out and I really didn't want to drive further. Anyway, we kept driving and when we were heading into grapevine California which is just over tejon pass and into the valley we started to encountered black smoke like something was burning  but apparently there was no fire so the source is unknown but we no longer saw what appeared to us to be a missile either.  .Anyway, this had both of us quite alarmed and freked out so we stopped in a parking lot to calm down a bit and as we sat in the car we saw a small ball f light flash and dissappear with incredible speed that surprised both of us and this light seemed to come from no where as well.  That is about al I have to say about what i saw except that it was very freaky and I probably will not be forgetting it anytime soon.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Source is anonymous.

It caught our attention because it was raining and of course cloudy and we knew it could have not been a star or the moon. When we first sighted it this bright light seemed to be about 2 miles West of us.  As we got closer to it, it seemed to be like the U.F.O. that we always see in the movies, disc like and with many very bright lights around it.  When we finally reached it we passed right under it and seemed to almost look like an airplane except the bottom of the 2 wings each had 3 square windows with very very bright lights.  At first we were joking in the car \"oh look that looks like an U.F.O.\" and we laughed.  After we passed this object (which was still stationary) about 1/2 mile, we see this object make a semi-circle turn faster than anything I ever seen fly.  All of the sudden this object is again in front of us.  Now we are getting a little scared because this object kept following us.  Every time we made a turn and or passed trees, we would think that we would lose it, or IT lose us and the object again would speed up and catch up to us.  Now we are really scared so we used our cell phone to call the relatives whose home we had just left in Holmdel.  But could you imagine calling your brother-in-law and telling him \"we think we are being followed by an U.F.O, please stay on the line until we get home\".  We lost connection but then we called our relatives back and they stayed on the line until we got home.  As soon as we pulled into our driveway in our home in Manalapan this object disappeared and we didn't see it again.  After 45 mins. of contemplating whether to report this to the police or not, because of course they are going to think that I'm crazy, I finally called the police and they said \"we have so many air force activity right now that it was probably something related with the air force.

It was a few degrees brighter than Venus when I first noticed it.  Moving diagonally downward toward the west, it began to lose intensity.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but then before it lost all of its light, it curved upwards and diminished.  I put the hose down and kept my eyes on the spot from which I had last seen it.  Then, approximately 5 seconds later, it reappeared as a faded point and increased in brightness until it was again the intensity I had first seen.  Its path was again in the shape of an 'S' lying on its side.  As it curved upward and began to lose its brightness, I noticed a halo around the dimming spot.  It almost looked like an object at this point, (as opposed to a star radiating light). It then disappeared and I saw nothing more.\n\r\nI observe the sky a lot, and I don't have an explainaion for it.

As it came closer I noticed another light (soft yellow light) going from one side all the way around the front to the other side, repeatedly. As it came closer I noticed this light was all together seperate from the green one. As it approached the hi-way a bus in front of me hit its passenger lights to let kids off the bus. When it did that, the smaller light went under the green light and lit up, also the green light lit up. I realized then there were two craft, the yellow one was the size of a large truck and the green one was as big as a football field.

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around object, Aircraft nearbyWedge formation of 5 round (or disc) shaped objects glowing pale green flying north incredibly fast  on 9/30/01 @ 7:15PM over Portland\n\n\n\r\nSaturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner.\n\r\nI was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next.\n\r\nFor the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW.\n\r\nLiterally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said \"What's that?\" and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on.\n\r\nBasically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn't appear to be navigation lights, as they weren't points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface.\n\r\nThe shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them.\n\r\nThey flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished.\n\r\nNaturally, we started yelling \"Oh my God - did you see that???\" and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn't think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn't a plane because of the impossible velocity.\n\r\nI was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I'm sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too.\n\r\nIt was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Witness states dates of January 30 and September 30.  We presume he means September 30.  PD",

The owner of the farm said that their wasn't another house for about 3 miles. We decided to check it out. The lights were about 300 yards away.  We walked for a while as we got to 100 yards the lights started to flicker at different intervals. Some red flashes came about every 15 seconds.  As we got closer we could see that it was some sort of object. It was Long and cigar shaped it looked as if it was made out of stainless steel. Their were no markings or windows. there wasn't even any noise.As we got within 50 yards it started to move forward.

They caught my eye because there were no planes flying at that time due to the terrorist attacks.  I went outside to get a better look.  They were far brighter than any of the surrounding stars.  They were aligned at the same latitude, about 40 degrees up.  The one on the right was blinking, the one on the left was not.\n\r\nThey were stationary for the most part, however the one on the right seemed to \"jiggle\".  I grabbed my Sony 8mm video camera from inside and went back out and started filming.  I tried several times to zoom in on the one on the right which was more active, but the digital zoom had difficulty focusing on it.  However, the video does show some interesting things.  First, when I zoomed in on the object on the right it is blurry but you can clearly see the changing colors - white, red, green, gold changing very rapidly.  Second, there is a point when the object on the right can clearly be seen moving quickly from left to right, then stopping and remaining stationary.   Several people have watched the video and agree that it does not look or behave like stars, planets, orbiting satellites, or aircraft.  I went back to bed with the objects still up there, so I do not know how long they remained.

My secon impression was that it was a military test of some kind.  2 more lights were observed a few minutes later, more toward the north, but in the same apparent altitude.

There was pavement for a few miles, but after a while it turned to gravel. So once i hit the gravel, it was very difficult to drive due to the heavy raining. still travelling west, i knew i'd have to make a left turn in order to get to Pense, but was not sure which road was the turn-off. So, i took a guess, and saw lights, which appeared to be a small town(it was). So i made a left. When i was turning, I saw no lights, directly in front of me, but once i completed the turn i looked down for a second looked up and there appeared to be a vehicle in front of me. I thought at the time how weird this seemed, but i thought that perhaps someone was pulled over and started their vehicle right then. So i slowed down and followed what i thought to be a vehicle of some sort. i thought the lights at the time seemed unusual, but i kept making excuses, like maybe they looked weird because it was so dark? at first they kind of looked like a vehicles lights? maybe. it was so long ago. but after awhile there seemed to be wiggling lights in between two red lights. i thought \"what the heck would make wiggling lights like that?\" i thought \"ok, it must be a car or something, maybe pulling a trailer, and that would maybe explain the wiggling ?\" I was a little afraid, but calmed myself down be thinking i was imagining things. So i was! getting closer and closer to pense, this thing was in front of me, i looked down for a brief second and up again, and whatever it was completely dissapeared. Far fetched hey? i thought there had to be a logical explanation for this. There was no right hand turns for this vehicle to go down, it was not ahead of me as i would have seen it, as highway #1 was ahead a few miles and the road was a little illuminated by lights, so i would have seen it, and the left hand turn into Pense would be the only place that this vehicle could have turned onto, but there was not enough time for this object to make a left-hand turn into town. But i decided to go down this only road and drive fast and look to see if there were any vehicles that may have just turned, but there was nothing for vehicles around, and the adjoining streets also had nothing for vehicles. and that is my story. I still wonder about that night. there are absolutely no explanations. this is the gospel truth, i swear!\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

They were driving northbound on US-1 in the early AM in the dark before sunrise in the vicinity of what is now known as Pinecrest. In the 1960's, it was a semi-rural area.  My dad spotted what he thought was an aircraft to the north of their position.  He said it was a very bright white light that stayed in one position.  He assumed that it was an airplane with its landing lights on heading for Miami International Airport. When it didn't appear to turn he was afraid that it may be making an emergency landing on the highway! As my mom and dad became concerned, the object shot away to the west at incredible speed. My dad said that it left like a bullet shot from a gun, leaving only a line in the sky. This was no airplane.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

I was 1 mile west of where Latson Rd. crosses Clyde Rd.\n\r\nSuddenly, overhead and left of the road I noticed a bright white fireball trailing a line of blue and white sparks descend at a rapid pace.  It was traveling west to east, but was headed in a distinct downward trajectory--as opposed to the few others I've seen personally or on video that travel parallel to the horizon.  Its diameter was about the size of a pea held at arm's length.  It was much larger and brighter than what is seen during a meteor shower (i.e.,  falling stars).  As I said, I first noticed it through the top left of my windshield as it shot downward at what I guessed to be a 60 degree angle.  It descended below the horizon.\n\r\nI thought it might hit maybe 10 miles east of where I was, which would be northeast of the area around Hartland, MI, near the intersection of M-59 and US-23.  I have heard of reference made to it on radio stations that it was a satellite reflection.  No way! Coincidentally, this is the second such object I have seen from this exact location, which I also reported on this web site.  That sighting was a widely-reported trail of fireballs seen across the midwest about two years ago.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We wonder whether the witness intended to indicate a time of 1939 hrs.

One witness I interviewed, said that she saw a huge blazing orange ball of fire moving north. During the evening I learned that other similar reports originated from Armstrong and Mercer Counties.  I was also told that emergency centers near Youngstown, Ohio received many sighting reports.  A resident of Allegheny County, near Pittsburgh, had knowledge that police in that area also received reports of something moving across the sky. I also interviewed a witness from Latrobe, PA in Westmoreland County, who watched  a big orange-red ball of fire \"as bright as the moon\" followed by a glowing tail which tapered off in thickness.

My nephew was the first to see the object, yelling at my sister to stop the vehicle, etc.  She didn't at that time.   Then, as they traveled a lil further, he saw it again, pointing and tellign her to pull over.\n\r\nShe did.  She describes the object as this:   Blimp-Like object....smooth...no ribbling or lines like a blimp.  RED..Bright Red...glowing red...(it was an overcast cloudy day, no sun), she said it had black square things on the bottom...several.   There were two doors that were open, like barn doors....that had a V-shaped item come out, and that had 6 circles on each side of the V.....Said it didn't move. No noise...nothing.\n\r\nThey watched it for like 5 min.  Said it intrigued her, yet sorta scared her.   She said she went to drive a lil further down the road, and took her eyes off it, and so didn't my nephew, and when they looked back...it was gone.  That fast.\n\r\nBeing how a blimp cannot travel that fast....she was really skeptical about mentioning it.   However, since my nephew as well, saw it, she said, it was hard not to tell someone. So, she told my mother and I, and I told her to report it.  She hesitated, and then finally decided she wouldn't, but said I could.\n\r\nSoo, I am reporting it.

Maybe a 4th- 5th the size of tonights moon. Anyhow, the object faded away quickly, travelling northwestward. It appeared to be very high in the sky when I lost sight of it. It seemed, maybe within 10000 feet when I first saw it. The object made no noise. I am a veteran skywatcher and I have seen satellites travel through the night sky, reflecting the sun.They usually, I believe, have a yellowish hue, and are never close to being this vivid.

This object had no running lights, left no contrail and was completely silent.  It looked for all the world like the detached wings of a glider aircraft.  It was silhouetted clearly in the night sky because the sky was clear and there was an almost full moon in the Eastern sky, low in the horizon.

I stopped the car and got out, and noticed that it was getting close and still wasn't making any noise of any kind. I got back in the car and started the engine. There were some trees in the way so I couldn't see the \"craft\" now, so I turned around and headed east. I looked to my right and the triange had changed direction almost like it knew i was trying to follow it and was scared away and was now headed east as well, and as it started to really pick up some speed I now could no longer follow it. But I could still see it, and the white lights started to turn red and blue, they didn't change like a light going on, more like a transition.

It was bright and had a strong white light as it streaked. It was travelling a an amazing amount of speed, leaving a trail of light that would fade quickly after passing section of the sky. Thinking it was simply a shooting star I watched it pass over the sky for about 9 seconds across a section of the dark night sky. Then without any warning it automaticly changed direction, it tuned back about 73 degrees on itself and sped for a few more seconds before dissapearing. Its entrence was as sudden as it's dissapearence. But for those last 3 seconds the craft flickered like a candles flame glowing a slight red.

Then I noticed it was \"staionary\" and not moveing, after 15 minutes. I then, thought perhaps, it was a comet. Since I have not followed, any reports on comets like Hale/Bopp. This contrail, was, then \" degradeing\" yet, a new contrail was being formed. I could see clearly, a \"jet\" large airliner being, in slow motion, or stopped in the sky. Below that a small round, grayish \"U.F.O.\" wa dancing, and going back and fourth, under the airliner. The airliner was stationary, burning fuel, and creating a contrail, as this UFO hovered about 7 thousand feet \"under\" the large liner. I noticed many people watching this in the Bartow, Daggaet(Solar Power area)and this, was 50 miles from Edwards airforce base. I clearly saw a round UFO,and this jet, with small contrail, and it was redish, with the sun, setting, and was below the hortizon, or mountains. It was \"beautiful\" and \"spectacular\", and was the most bizzar, thing I ever see. I felt it was showing off for all the cars traveling along I-40, that evening. I called the Highway Patrol in Barstow, they said they got hundreds of phone calls on this. They said it was a helicopter. I say it was a UFO, round, gray, and makeing a motion, for attention. Then after I was under it, the UFO , went away, and the \"airliner\" was free, to travel, to its destination.",

I was looking at the moon through the sunroof top of the car and all of a sudden a light appeared out of nowhere.It looked just like a regular star, but it was moving so i knew it wasnt a star. I kept following it, and it kept making these sharp curves, going slowly then fast and vice versa. But then as it was going away from the moon it started dimming out and finally disappeared. It didnt come back until a half hour later, and it was all the way on the other side of the sky. It did the same movements, dimmed out and disappeared once again. That was the last i saw of it.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

We drive to a more remote location to scrutinize it better. To our astonishment, this \"red star\" starts moving slowly, from all sides. A few minutes later, it starts doing fast turns and circles in the sky. It eventually fades to the point where it was easy to lose sight of. Then, in another area of the sky, the light reappears and shifts from left to right slowly before disappearing. Seconds later, the light, possibly the same craft- but with a different appearance and white color, reappears in a closer mountain range. It is moving towards us now and the light becomes brighter from whatever this thing is! Out of extreme fear, we get in the car and drive as fast as we can down the mountain, risking a serious car accident. As I look back at this object, while driving erratically, I could see that this object was close enough for me to see three white lights. We must've escaped quick enough because by the time we got on the main road, that's leads down the mountain, the object was out of sight.\n\r\nThis all happened about an hour ago and I'm still in shock.",

Hood National Forrest SW of Mt Hood near mile marker 8 on Hiway 58 at the end of a 1/2 mile logging spur. We had just put the children to bed and were preparing to sleep in the back of my truck. It was a cloudless moonless night from our perspective. looking towrds the SE at the mountains a 'silver orange' or 'chrome orange' ball popped up from behind the mountain range and made a very slow circle around our camp at an altitude of aproximately 5-6 K ft. The object moved from the SE to the East and then headed to the NW, then to the NE and then popped back down below the mountains. It made no noise and moved as if it were drunk - it jerked back and forth and wiggled a bit. It appeared to be about the size of the end of a pencil held at arms legnth. The beginining and ending of its journey was very strange because it looked as if it was on a spring.\n\r\nI turned off our coleman lantern during its flight so it would not spot us and so I could see it better.\n\r\nWe had seen a small private single engine propeller plane about a 1/2 hour before that went from east to west.\n\n\n\r\n--- Peter Davenport <director@ufocenter.com> wrote:\n\r\nDear Mr. ((name deleted)),\n\r\nThank you very much for the very interesting report!\n\r\nDo you know, were there other witnesses in the campground, who might have seen the object, as well?

I hope to be able to file the other events as time permits. \n\r\nAt the time my girlfriend saw it too but, she is now my ex girlfriend and I have had to file a restraining\r\norder against her. I am unable to give you any details about her whereabouts at this time. \n\r\nI am not quite sure of the date but it was at the end of August in 2000 and a Saturday night.

She was concerned about terrorist activity, and wanted me to see it. I rushed out.\n\r\nI was it instantly. It appeared to be the size and intensity of a very bright star but perhaps brighter than the brightest star. It had blueinsh cast.  Over the ten minute period that I observed it, it moved very rapidly, yet erratically, over a broad area of the ski. Its movement seemed to be quite erratic, reminding me more of the movement of a bat (but not the appearance of one)in flight. It might move in a straight line for no more than a second, then switch directions for another second, and then continue this erratic movement. It was dark and just beginning to rain and I could not see if there were clouds. It did not appear to disappear behind clouds. It did not flicker, and remained totally visible unless I would lose sight of it behind a tree. When this happened, within a second or so, it would reappear from behind the object. In spite of the erratic and random nature of its movement, it did seem to be confined to a reasonably small area of the ski. I would estimate the horizontal boudaries of its excursion to be perhaps 30 or 40 degrees, and the vertical, perhaps a little less.\n\r\nAfter a minute or so of watching it, I ran into the house to grab a video camera and ran out to try to catch it on video. I was never able to get it into the view finder, a failure that I found rather disturbing, sine I am very adept at video movies. For what it is worth, not once did I get a glimps of it in the view finder. I speculated that the intensity was not sufficient or that it was moving too fast for me to catch it, though the latter does not seem to be a reasonable explanation.\n\r\nEventually, it disappeared by moving behind a tree, down toward the horizon.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.

I was on my way back from the gas station when I noticed a spotlight hitting the ground next to my van, wile I was driving. Were I live, they have a lot of police helicopters patrolling the area at night, so I didn't pay any attention. The light hit my van and as it did I rolled down the window and waved above my van. Even though I could not see what I though might be a police helicopter. I realized something was wrong. I couldn't here any helicopter blade noise! It was at that time I also noticed that the car behind me had slammed on it breaks and was stopped in the middle of the road a ways back. Also as I passed the intersection I noticed the person stopped at the light had his head hanging out the window and was staring at my van, as I drove bye. By that time the spotlight went out. I looked out my side window and that's when I saw the dam thing. It couldn't have been more then 40 feet above my van. It was the size of my van looked spherical. The thing was blinking rapidly about 3 to 4 blinks a sec. a red orange color. But the bottom of it was a real bright greenish blue. The whole thing was lit up. There was a fool moon out that night with a few clouds and you could see this thing as bright as the moon it self! About a sec. After I first saw this thing, it shot out in front of me. I hit the gas and followed it. I was doing about 60 chasing it, when we got to a park that was in that area. It suddenly went right, towards the park and stopped for a minute, above a big tree. I turned in to the parking lot almost flipping my van and grabbed my video camera from under the seat. I started filming! Thank God I had my camera in the car. It slowly drifted southeast. No sound what so ever. There were times it would just shoot off at real high speed and I would have to find it again with my camera. I drove to the end of the parking lot and got some more good footage. When I got there I noticed there were a! lot of people there watching this thing to. They started coming towards me.  I found out they were there in the park for a late birthday party. To my surprise they also had cameras! ! ! We all watched it dart around and accelerate away right in to a cloud. As weird as it sounds, when it did there would be lightning flashes but no thunder!?!? It did this a few times. We could see it go in (flash) then it would come back out for a few minutes. Then it would do it again, then (flash) but still no thunder. Then it just went away. I got every one on video and we all exchanged numbers. I know there were more people that saw this when I while driving, but they drove away in a hurry!\n\n",

During the game, a cameraman focus and zoomed-in on a couple of spinning diamond shaped objects that were over the Los Angeles Coliseum.  The network broadcasters noticed it and started talking about \"how curious\" the objects where.  The objects appeared to be metallic in structure and were hovering a few hundred feet above the staduim.  As they turned, you could make out the obvious flash of metal when the sunlight hit the sides of it.  It appeared to spin on its corner points (as if a compass - north and south) and in a left to right spin.  The cameras stayed on this for about 2 minutes and then the cameras cut back to the game.  It has been almost 22 years since I've seen this, but I clearly remember the things I saw.  They were not the Goodyear blimp, or any type of news helicopter covering the game.  My older brothers and some cousins and I were watching the game.  I was 13 at the time.  I remember that there was a news blurb about it later, but never remember seeing or hearing anything about it after that.  Unfortunatly I don't have a copy of the came, you may want to find a copy of the broadcast of this game to view.

It began to move west as I approached the intersection of Routes 7 and 164. It was at this point that I got a good look at it. In the middle of the thing was a sunset-orange, horizontally oriented rectangular light. It shone relatively brightly and had a solar quality, like the sun in its setting position. Set directly above and below the orange light were 2 smaller horizontal rectangles, powder blue in color and dimmer in comparison to the middle of the object. On the top and bottom object were singular, whitish lights blinking on and off about twice a second.\n\r\nAfter watching it closely for around a minute, it began to head directly towards the west, kind of quickly in my opinion, and hung frozen on the distant horizon. Eventaully, I lost sight of it because of the terrain of the highway.\n\r\nThis was the first night planes were allowed back in the sky since the attacks on 9/11, so I was shocked to see such a unconventional thing in the sky sharing airspace with several other visible, normal looking aircraft. I thought perhaps it was a blimp, but have seen them at night before, and this object looked quite dissimilar. Plus it moved way too fast for such a thing. I then thought it was military, but if it was, taxpayers should be mad because this thing looked functionless and of the dumbest design compared to any other military craft I have ever seen. I doubt it was a helicopter since I could see no solid outline anywhere and the object was void of any kind of noise that I could here.\n\r\nI am an experienced television director so I am used to making quick, detailed observations.

It was on a weekend. I'm a weekend musician and played mostly Fridays and Saturdays. The place we were playing that night no longer exists so I guess I can mention the name. The name of the place was called the Barn in a small town of smithville. I was riding with the sound man. We stopped at a stop sign close to where we had to make a left turn to enter the Club parking lot. I was not driving. The person who was did not see it, and at the time I did not mention it at first. The shape is hard to tell it was very dark in that area. I do remember 3 very large windows on the right side of the craft. It moved very slowly north. I only saw it briefly so I didn't get much detail. It wasn't until I got to the club that I would discover exactly what it was. After arriving at the club, the sound man,myself and a few others were unloading the equipement from the van when the lead singer showed up with the two people that she had been riding with. They had taken a different route to the club. They were all very excited and leaped out of the car shouting, \"did you see it?, did you see it?\" The first words out of my mouth were, did it have 3 large windows on it's side? They replyed that it did and started to tell us all what they had encountered.  Once they had noticed it they stopped the car on the side of the road. The to younger girls got out to look at it while the older woman stayed in the car. They were shouting at it to land and were waving their arms in the air when it just disappeared from right over their heads. I haven't seen the girls in a long time but I know I can trace them down if I have too. The older woman to this day will not discuss what she saw for fear of being labeled unstable.

This was in Sidney, MT (pop - 3000 at the time). It was 9:00 at night when I and my Brother were walking to the grocery store to get candy for my upcoming birthday party. As we were walking down the street we stopped and noticed 3 lights above us. At first we thought it was a prank of some kind but then we both suddenly got a strange (but exciteing) feeling. We did not see the body of this craft...only the lights. They were blue, red and green - 3 of them. They were in the shape of a saucer dish. And I remember the lights seemed to 'jiggle' a little (vibrating with no set rhythm). There was no sound. It was like this thing was on mute. As we were looking at this thing, a 4-wheel drive truck came tearing around the corner and skidded up to a stop right beside us...the driver leaned out his window and said; \"did you see that...I've been following it for 1/2 an hour!\". And we just pointed upward. Anyway, this thing suddenly disappeared and we scanned the sky and saw it off in a distance at the other end of town. It disappeared again and immediately re-appeared at the other side of town. The only other thing I remember is that it felt like this thing was right above the telephone poles. I still remember thinking that I could have thrown up a rock and hit it if I wanted too.\n\r\nWhat really surprised us was the next day when there was an article in the local newspaper stating that there were several sightings of a UFO reported to the police station. I need to go back and see if I can retrieve that article somehow (if its possible). I've never spoken of this experience (only to a few people).\n\r\nThis happened in Sidney, Montana (November 1977 - early evening - dark out)\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Aircraft nearbycraft seen near Seymore-Johnson AFB, N.C., 1960\n\r\nIt was the summer of 1960 and my brother and I were in our back yard around 4p.m. talking to our neighbor who had a small garden on our property.  My brother was around 12 years old and the neighbor was a male around 40 at the time.  We lived within 5-8 miles of Seymore-Johnson Airforce Base and were used to B-52's and Tankers flying directly over just prior to landing.  On this day, 3 to 5 tankers were landing one behind the other with approximately 20-30 sec. between them.  When the first one flew over, (which is about 1/2 mile up), my brother and I and the neighbor saw a round object, no color, just black, hovering just outside of the flight path, but at the same altitude as the tankers.  It was approx. the size of the horizontal tail section of the tanker, not very large.  It kept it's position until the last tanker flew over and then the object instantaneously began flying along side the tanker at the same speed.  This means it went from zero speed to whatever speed the tankers were flying, I'm guessing 200 mph.  The object followed the tanker until it went behind a row of trees.  The object did not seem to be making any sounds of it's own at least different from the tankers, but then the tankers were very loud and the object could have been making some kind of sound.  We told our parents who didn't seem too concerned and we never discussed it again.  We know it wasn't a bird or balloon, but it was an aircraft without wings, round or spherical and could go from zero to 200 mph. instantaneously.  We did not call the base either.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.  PD",

            "characteristics": "Aura or haze around objectTwo lights in the sky interacting with each other in the most astounding way\n\r\nA light caught my attention as me and my friend were standing outside the house and talking quietly late at night. I looked up at a plane flying past and a small light dot in the sky caught my eye. I asked my friend whether he could see what i was seeing and it took some time before he confirmed that he could see what i saw. We stood there for 20 seconds and we watched it move in a sharp parabolic path and then resume a straight direction as if it were turning on to a course. I got very exited and i asked my friend whether he had a pair of binoculars and he said yes and ran to get them from inside his house. Once he got out i still had my eye on this faint object. At the beginning of the sighting it was bright and then later it started getting darker as it moved over away from us towards the distant horizon in a diagonal motion. I managed to aim the binoculars at the light dot by using one eye to focus on the light dot and the other eye to search through one of the binocular lenses. Next, I saw the most remarkable sight that almost sent me into tears from exitement. I saw the little dot clearly in my binoculars and obviously it was much larger due to the binoculars' magnification. It still was a light dot though but a bit larger and no real distinct features were seen. Further on through the sighting, I kept focusing on the light dot as it moved and then i lost sight of it due to myself shaking from the cold. I managed to regain the sight of the light dot but i also managed to gain sight of something even more astounding that i cannot comprehend clearly. The light continued on but it \"met up\" with a larger cigar shaped craft that was around 12 times the size of this light dot. I could see the whole craft and it was truly enormous compared to the light dot. The dot then moved towards this huge craft and went up very close to the cigar shaped craft and stayed really close for about 30 seconds and then started shining brighter and became a bit larger and move perpendicular to the cigar shaped crafts hull ! or fusel age. It moved away to the left in my point of view and i felt heart broken to have to be able to choose which craft to observe since they both were increasing their distance from each other. I decided to look at the light dot and it was bright for a short period of time before resuming to a darker shade like the shade observed before the approach of the cigar craft. I was describing everything that i was seeing to my friend who was standing next to me and asking what was happening. Once the craft was some distance away from the cigar shaped craft (I presume) then it started travelling faster and faster until i could hardly keep up with the binoculars. It kept going faster and became darker and darker and dissappereared into black. I tryed refocusing back on to the cigar shaped craft but i could not find it in the night sky. I knew that i was viewing all of this near the horizon but it was up in the sky, very high up. I was shaken because of the sight that i encountered and I till today remember it very clearly. It remains one of the greatest sights that i have ever seen in my life. I have sighted similar lights when i was out on holidays but i never saw such variations in movement and interaction with other lights in the sky. I currently go out in summer on hoilday to the country just to dedicate time into viewing the lights and/or even greater observations.",

I was sitting out on my balcony taking some sun as it was a clear warm cloudless day. As I took a break from it I watched an aircraft fly over me at cruising altitude leaving a contrail. There is a flight corridor right overhead (west -&gt; east) for most likely intercontinental flights. About five to ten minutes after the aircraft went out of sight (balcony's ceiling). I noticed a bright white light moving thru the sky. It was a constant blinking light in about one second interval, moving in my point of view in the exact same place and direction as the contrail left by the recent aircraft. But the speed was 6 - 8 times faster (or even more) than the normal aircrafts that slowly move across the sky. There were no change of speed what so ever. I didn't see any object during the \"no light\" period. Maybe it was behind the contrail. But the blinking light was so strong it seemed to be below the contrail. This made me think this thing was actually moving IN the contrail. The contrail wasn't affected in any way as it was slowly disappearing. The size of the light was about twice of a big airliner flying at cruising altitude. I'd say the light moved over the part of the sky I can see (about 40% of total) in about 15 seconds.\n\r\nThe huge speed, bright blinking light, moving exactly where the contrail was, made no sense to me and still I'm wondering what it was. \n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

It was square shaped with two blue lights on the two corners to the left as you look at it and two red lights on the two corners on the right. There was a white or yellow light in the center, but it didn't attract your attention as much as the blue and red lights did and the fact that it was square.  The sky was pitch black so you only saw the lights on the formation of the square.  By the time I slowed the car down to a stop the object was in the sky above the tree line, but far enough away you couldn't see details, just the shape and the lights.  It didn't appear to be moving and we couldn't take our eyes off of it.  When my passenger rolled the window down to see even better, it took off heading west, but only for a split second and then was completely gone from the sky.  It wasn't a helicopter; there wasn't any noise and it was square, and of course we know what a helicopter looks like.  It wasn't a plane obviously, because in wasn't moving, simply above us in the sky and again it was square and planes don't hover in one spot above the trees.

They had some strange red cross like lights on the bottom not all of them but at least 3.

It was like the big green light the first one flew in then a smaller one came out of it, and a smaller one came out of that one, and then a smaller one came out of that one.  They looked like they were dropping into a river not far from where we were.  This went on for about 10 minutes and then the green light flew away.

It was pulsing rapidely It seemed to have a blue or green light on the bottom I could not believe my eyes As I watched the van go through the light it looked to me as if this thing was fallowing the van. What happened next was astounding In fact scared me to the point of panicking I tried to put my car in reverse I could not find the gear. I watched this thing explode a beam of light on to the ground next to the van then the light swept through the van not around it but through it as if it was cutting right in to the metal All I could think of was getting out of there I never drove so fast in my life.

I was in the north wing (radiology dept.) at Sunbury community hospital (Snyder county (central) Pennsylvania) where I work. I am an avid \"skyfisher\" with my camcorder and enjoy sky watching. I was looking (as i do throughout the day) for \"odd\"/chemtrail activity but instead saw two unusual objects. The more stationary of the two was larger and seemed  to exhibit no anomalous motion. approximate range seemed to be about at least 2-4 miles. Clear blue skys (for once ;). The smaller object appeared to be moving southeast at about double the speed of the first. The larger object appeard brighter than the smaller, mobile object. My impression was that of two mylar ballons catching the sun, but why at that range would one move consistantly away from the other at twice the speed, while the other remained relatively motionless? Since it's been 19 years since i last saw a \"UFO\" i called two associates who saw the same thing. Since one is a smoker and was going out for a smoke break i asked her to look for them from outside, to no avail. She later asked me about the objects she had seen from inside but not outside, I had no aditional info. thus no response.\n\r\nANYWAY......... Hope to correlate potential sighting with other PA skywatchers during this time.  Somewhat skeptical of actual saucer since no overt contraindiction of modern Physics was observed.\n\r\nPeace!

The craft was about 20 miles away above a Air Force called Wright Patterson AFB. The craft was really just a very bright light, thats why I said the shape was unknown. I said there were possibly 2 because the craft moved around for about 30 seconds and then it disappered, and then re-appeared, so I don't know if this was the same craft or a second.

Nothing more was said but the last two days (Oct. 8 and 9th) in Las Vegas, NV while viewing Telemundo, a major Spanish speaking channel, there has been much airing of the footage, actually extended over what what shown during the day of the event.  This time it was being commented on in Spanish and shown on the screen was the object, a disk shaped, silverish object, quite large, seemingly the size of a couple of busses seen to be hovering between the towers, after the first airplane hit, but before the first tower collapsed and before the second airplane crashed.  The footage was being shot from a close by helicopter and narrated in English by a female newscaster. She pointed out the object to the cameraman with a startled \"look over there, what is that\".  The cameraman's comment was much more graphic, such as \"what the **** is that?!\"  He filmed it for a few seconds and then the disk shot out from between the buildings and directly towards them.  The woman sounds like she is exclaiming, screaming slightly and the camera guy says something and actually leans back and films from a reclining angle as the object careens rapidly up and past them.  This footage has been aired several times and each time seeing it it's quite startling.  My original comment to the kids before seeing it was that it must be some kind of secret surveillance craft that we have and don't want anyone to know about but upon viewing it, one just can't believe that we have such a capacity.  I've seen the comments from around the world of people who viewed something like this and would like to have this investigated.  Is there some sort of news blackout that has prevented this particular shot from being re-aired in the U.S.  Interestingly today it was announced that Sony is buying this network.  Maybe the type of freely decided upon ! news for mat will be curtailed.  Hope not, because this is really happening and people deserve to have some sort of explanation - if only to be told that the government is aware of, or acknowledging this as \"real\". We typically don't watch this channel, but our son does at times. We've had the video tape in since then, to record this footage if it airs again, but it must be public record somewhere that your agency can investigate.  My husband even advised me not to write because it was so frightening.  Any comments?",

I first saw what appeared to be a military aircraft flying from south to north - a white light with a red light and a blue light on it, and was flying rather fast. Not an odd occurrence given that there are several military bases in the front range area here in Colorado. However, I knew it was not a military craft when it stopped in mid-air and the red and blue lights disappeared. The single white light, which was now a little brighter (like a very bright star), started to bob up and down and around in the air, almost like a flying insect or a moth. I knew that since I was seeing this against the fixed backdrop of the stars that this one object was indeed moving, and it wasn't just my eyes. It became stationary, and while I was watching for additional movements I fell asleep. The total time I watched this event was about 15 minutes.

They appeared to be in a fixed position, perhaps a bit lower than the stars. Their movement was slow, just like the stars, indicating the objects' perceived movement was actually due to the Earth's rotation. The base of the Y-shape was the brightest, looking somewhat like a cluster of three adjacent stars. The angles at the top of the Y were like lighted lines, not as bright as the base. On some nights we have seen a short line extending downward from the middle of the base of the Y. We have since seen these objects moving from west to east between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night when the skies have been clear. They are probably visible much later into the night, but we haven't stayed up later. Our suspicion is that these are U.S. spy satellites grouped in position for sightings of overseas locations as part of the War on Terrorism, but attempts to confirm this have failed. We have been told the spy satellites are too high in the sky and to small to be visible without powerful telescopes, but we have also read that newer, and perhaps bigger, spy satellites have been in development for some time. Some other people in our area have also seen these Y-shaped objects in the sky.

This ball then moved horizontally northward and then eastward in my direction.  I was driving westward towards the object.   The horeshoe is just a curve in the road on Nike Ave.  and after the curve it is a straight road for about 9-10 miles.  As I drove towards the objest ( about 5 miles ) it also came towards me. It traveled about total 8-10  miles (not sure this distance) from mountain top to middle of the missle range where I stopped my car midway down Nike Ave.\n\r\nThe object in its travel changed color from fire orange and circular to a luminous white.  It was about  a block away in the desert.  It looked like a huge lightbulb desending from a height of about  30 feet  to where I thought it might touch down on the ground but it did not.  It kicked up a little desert dust for only a second then huvered in one spot about 10 feet off the ground.  It did not wobble or drift in any direction from the first time I obsevved it to the time I later lost site of it.  It traveled like it was programmed to follow a digital course or never made any course corrections as it moved.  I figure it took about less than 5 minutes to travel from the mountain top to the middle of the road or the 8 mile trip.\n\r\nWhen I stopped my car on the road I stopped delibertly  to have my headlights facing the thing.  It did not land but stopped and did not move in any direction.  It just stayed put and it did not rotate or pitch.  It looked like a lightbulb about 6 feet across and about 10 feet tall.  glass end up.\n\r\nit had a dark socket underneith....just like a litebulb.   I thought it might be a hot air balloon but it was incondesently bright.  If people were in it they would have to be in the glass section the bottom socket section was too small.  There was no ropes between sections.  The two sections were connected directlly together.  I then saw the thing turn its light off and I told myself don't blink and watch to see if this thing would turn on again.  I was thinking if it was a hot airballoon I would see the delay of small fire ignition to maximum turn on of full throttle propane burn.\n\r\nWell, I did not blink and I thought I could see beyond the thing (like it became transparent for a second)  then it turn to full brillancy instantly (like you turn on a lightbulb).  There was no flutter of flame as a hot airballoon does and the thing never changed altitude.  I thought  that if anyone was in the thing they would have had there night vision obsured for the high intensity of the light that came from within.  I couldn't see anything inside if it even had a inside.  All I saw was a giant lightbulb flying in the air.  Next I decided to flash my headlights on and off to see if anything would happened.  At that point the thing started back the same way it had came back the exact course traveled before up to the mountain top.  As it was heading back I followed down the road in its direction but it was faster than my car.  Then it went over the mountain top and I lost site of it for a few moments.  About 10 minutes later it came over another mountain top and it looked like two car lights coming over the mountain top (above the mountain).  Each light came north together then flew away from each other (one east and the other west like synchonized swimming and then flew back to the mountain to be lost from site.  I also absorved a flashing red lite that looked like the light on a helicopter above the mountain right where the two lights flew.   Also this object didn't make any sound as it travel or stopped in the air.  When the object first came down along the mountain it lit up the mountain with its orange glow.  If this was balloonist they were flying in an are forbidden to fly (White Sands Missle Range artillary range) and they would be flying over very trecherous and dangerous mountain at night.  When the object flew back over the mountain it remained luminous white.   I don't know if it turned into two headlight at the end of the trip but these two lights were alot smaller in size and the flashing red light would be a third light .  All three lites were three seperate units.  The red lite stayed motionless over the mountain top while the white lites were moving in two different directions to each other.  All three came to the same are on the far side of the mountain and that is where I could not see them anymore.\n\r\nIt was the one day in my life I wish I has had a camera.  ((name deleted)).",

After a moment we heard the girls yealling \"aliens, Ufo,aliens!\" as parents we were listening but thought that the kids were just playing untill the screams got louder.  I walked out from under the yawning to look up and see a object about 1/2 mile above me.  The object that I at first thought was a air ballon was red,blue and yellow with a strobing light inside and was moving very slowly.  I called to the others to come and look.  We all just stood there with our mouths wide open and amazed with the colorful, lighted object. As the object was headed east and now about 1 mile away it begain to move at a 70 degree angle towards the clouds with no smoke or sounds.  At this time my sister remined me that I had a video camra and that I should be recording this. When the object became nothing but what appered to be a flashing plane light it went quickly to the east then immediately to the west heading into the cloud we watched for about a minute or two untill we no longer saw anything.  The storm cloud which it entered then began a strobing type lighting for about one minute then all was clear.  We exchanged info with another gentleman who had also been following this object.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n((<b>NUFORC Note:</b>To listen to an archived 3-hour radio program (11JN02) on the Jeff Rense program with both a witness to this event, and an experienced investigator of it, please go to the URL shown below:  \n\r\nhttp://events.yahoo.com/shows/endoftheline/02archives.html\n\r\nPD))",

Appeared long, tube shaped, like a paper towel tube. Brightness changed every 30 seconds or so. Appeared to be rotating slowly, possibly tumbling. NOTE: This object was DIRECTLY overhead. I observed it for two nights through a small telescope. My neighbor inquired about what I was doing. I pointed out the object. We then used his more powerful binoculars. The object was a single color (as like just plain metal, no lights, etc.). The third night we were again observing it when several small flashes appeared underneath it. About 5 minutes later, a silver ball shaped object dropped straight down through the broken clouds, executed a right angle turn and moved off to the east. The second ball moved to the north-east, the third and fourth to the south.\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that I was able to train the binoculars on one of the balls. It looked like a ball bearing or a pinball machine ball, chrome-like, no lights, window or other variations on the surface. I observed it going through clouds, leaving a trail of water vapor. The ground was covered with snow and the night was clear, so observation was about as perfect as it could be. My guess is around mach 1 with no sound or sonic boom.\n\r\nMy neighbor said he would contact the Air Force. He was in his 40s, I in my late teens, so that seemed logical. I didn't see him for a few days. When I did, I inquired about whether or not he called anyone. He stated firmly that he never saw anything and neither did I. The interesting thing to note is that my neighbor was a \"'60s liberal\", i.e. antiestablishment, VW bus, peace protester, demand answers from the government kind of guy.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

The object appeared like a star but was zig-zagging in the night sky. When I looked through my binoculers, I noticed that it appeared much like a jellyfish with two limbs and a light source inside. I contacted a friend who lives about 10 miles further west from me and he confirmed the object in the same westerly direction. The object also would dissapear behind clouds making the object higher in the sky then it really appeared.\n\r\nMy family witnessed the object along side of me and discribed the object as \"a  jellyfish-like object with two legs and a light inside\". I thought it looked more like a frog with two legs and with a light inside. We all agreed that it looked and moved much like a kite would and not a weather balloon. Weather balloons are usually oval or tear-drop shaped. Additionally, how could a kite fly well above the clouds?

            "characteristics": "Lights on object, Changed ColoTriangular shaped with \"mother of pearl\" swirling light...six green square lights all on bottom\n\r\nI was driving to an event for my brother.  I was late, as usual, so I was driving fast to get there.  I was whipping around the back roads of Malvern, PA. The road in particular is called Providence Rd.  People in the area know it as a short cut, but it is very hilly and out of the way.  I remember it was Sunday night, about 9:00 PM.  Noone on the road and as I came over this one hill I noticed three white lights in the distance (20 miles).  I was a clear night, and not that dark.  The sun had gone down not that long ago.  I thought this is cool, must be some sort of military jets or something because it looked like they were in formation.  But the more I looked they weren't that close together.\n\r\nSeparated from each other by more than 10 miles or so, but they looked similar...three bright white lights.  I was heading north on Providence so two of the objects were heading east, the ones farther away from me, and then I realized one of them was heading in my direction, heading south southeast!  Once again, I was excited because I just thought this thing was like a F-15 or something.  It kept getting closer and closer.  So I slowed down because noone was around and it looked like it was going to pass right over me so then once I realized that I came to a complete stop.  I opened my moonroof to get a good look, thinking I would see afterburners etc.\n\r\nInstead, I was shocked.  First there was no noise...nothing. The car was stopped and this was a desolate road. The only thing I heard were crickets.  The white light was on its front, but then it started to pass over.  I would say it was about 300-500 ft. up, actually very low for a flying object.  The speed was also slow, almost like it was giving me a show or something.  I could make out that it was a triangular shaped object.  Not a perfect triangle though.  It had a point in the front(where the white light was) then two straight lines/edges down the back and then two triangular shaped wings.  It really did look like a plane kind of, but trust me it was no plane because what I saw on the underbelly of this thing was like nothing I have ever seen, unless our military is way more advanced then I give them credit for.  Near the front of the craft on the bottom there was something I cannot even put into words.  It was a ball shaped object which almost looked suspended from the craft, and the thing that always sticks out and why I feel it was extraterrestrial was the color of this object.  The simple fact was, there was no one color.  It constantly changed color, and not like blue one second and then red. Not like that at all.  The only way I can describe it, it was like \"mother of pearl\".  The white would form with other colors...mixing..blues greens reds and yellows.....then swirl to another color, but the white was always the background.  It just kept changing as it passed over.  Then behind it were 6 green square lights three on a side in a row.  To the right and left of the last green lights was where the wings were.  I was so in shock and so stunned, I just stared as it passed.  I mean I am an intelligent guy, I believe that there could be life out there.  I guess I never thought I would see it.  Of course I didnt have a camera or anything.  After it passed I just sat there for about five minutes in shock.  Not thinking I should follow.  Then it dawned on me that I should and talk to someone about it! or reco rd it.  I started the car and kept going north looking for a place to turn around, and I saw the two other white lights again...still heading east.  I started to chase them but I realized they were too far and I couldnt gain ground on them...moving to fast. I am not sure if those were jets following it or other UFO's, but the thing that passed over me was definitely a UFO.  By the time I turned around to find that one, it was gone too.",

At first I thought it was a Plane of some sort but then I noticed it didn't omit any sound. The object passed by so quickly that I estimate that it was maybe 3500 to 4000 feet high. It may have been a lot higher but I'm not really sure about that. The Object was circular, solid in appearance but without any distinct markings. It almost resembled the color of a cloud.( offwhite) The object I feel was going supersonic speed because it was out of sight in no time at all, headed in a Northeast direction. When I first noticed the object, it was about the size of maybe a nickle or a quarter from my perspective. as it traveled to the Northeast, it rapidly decreased in size rapidly until I lost it over the Horizon. There were no clouds in the shy,just a beautiful evening. This is the first time that I ever noticed anything like this and I tell you that I was really taken back in awe about the event.

I looked out my window and saw a bright object traveling down at a 45 degree angle from south to north fairly fast.  When the light caught my attention I thought that it was a shooting star but as soon as I saw it realized that it was much larger than any shooting star I've ever seen.  It was round, slightly larger than a quarter (1 1/2 inch diameter) and was blue in the center surrounded by a white halo that extended approx. 3 inches around the circle.

When we focused we saw a cylinder shaped object falling from the sky. It was a teal green and had a white fuzziness around it. The sky is kind of cloudy tonight so there were reflections from them. It did not travel as fast as a falling star and it was not moving across the sky like a plane. It was more like a bomb falling from the sky. We are not sure how big it really was because we are not sure how far away it really was. From our viewpoint it was about a foot in length and 6' wide. Neither of us has seen anything like this before in our lives. We live right next to a major airport, Boeing Field, and air force bases. We see strange planes and such all the time. We are sure this was not a plane or anything. Because of the recent events we phoned the police, just in case it was not some kind of biological warfare device. I am sure they though we were crazy.

We used to walk around the city late at night in the summer months...or go out into the woods...essentially, we were trying to sneak around the city without anyone seeing us.  We were on our way home one night in July, and through the trees that lined the street, we saw somthing that scared us both to death, and that we did not talk about untill just recently.  Through the trees, we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a very large triangle.  It was easily 150 long and at least 50 feet wide.  It was floating very slowly, heading west.  There was a noise coming from the craft...a very low humming sound.  It was almost undetectable - as a matter of fact, if we wouldn't have been looking right at the craft, we probably wouldn't have noticed any noise at all.  It traveled slowly, maybe 10 miles an hour.  Neither one of us could believe our eyes, and we continued to chase it all the way down the street.  The most incredible thing about the craft was how low it was flying.  At most, it was 50 feet off the ground.  The white lights on the corners of the craft did not illuminate the craft so much as the street, so we couldn't really see what color the craft was, or what kind of material it was made of.  As we reached the end of the street, we were almost directly underneath the craft.  It then started to bank to it's left (south, tward the woods).  It traveled a bit further, at the same pace, and then we lost view of it because of the trees.  We could still see the white lights through the leaves, and then, abruptley, their was a huge flash of purple light from the center of the white lights (and if I remember correctly, the humming got more irritating...the pitch didn't change, it just got more intense), and then it was gone.  Neither one of us saw any of the lights lift up into the sky, they were just gone after the explosion of purple light.  I also remember a few seconds after it dissapeared, when the two of us were virtually shouting at ! each oth er \"Did you see that?\", I heard a boom - or a loud quick rumble in the sky - but very far away...in the distance.  He and I both ran to his house, which was only a few houses down from where we were watching, and told our parents what had happened.  They didn't believe us, or thought we were imagining it.  We didn't talk about it after that night until just recently, but both of our stories are still the same.  It was a terrifying and incredible experiance.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date is approximate.

My wife, myself and two friends where driving back from a haunted hay ride in poughkeepsie,NY. We where driving south on the NY state thruway back to NJ. It was a nice night and very clear. I opened the sun roof and was looking at the stars. As I was looking at the stars and saying how nice they where tonight, the others started looking at them too. Then I think it was my wife sitting in the backseat with her friend sayed look at that really bright star, she asked me if it was the north. I said no because we where looking east and low on the horizon. As I really looked at it, it appeared to move . I asked my friend to pull over. We stoped and really took a good look at this thing. Thier is no dout in my mind what we where looking at was no a star! It was moving in odd formations. So we thought it was a pland moving across the sky. But after a minute or two it was still in the same spot,but moving up then to the left , right ,down, it would even dim then become very bright again. Then move in ciculare motions, then dim out completely . Then BAM brighten up again.The shape of this THING was a triangel and very bright, I don't know what it was but.. It was something and I hope I have the oppertunity to see it again.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>If the sighting occurred \"Saturday night\" at \"12:45 p.m.,\" we suspect the witness means Sunday morning at 0045 hrs..

At each end was a dim star like light and three in the back. It moved slowly, quietly and was very large. The descrpition of a signting on your front page matches mine exactly, except my sighting, the object was moving slowly. {It was the April 27 2001 sighting with a drawing to go along with his story.} It is eery because I felt the same way, as if it was sneaky. I can't believe I noticed it, because it is as if it is camouflaged in the night sky. I just so happen to look up and notice three stars movng and thought that is odd, so I drove closer, and got out of my car and really took a good look at it. It was relatively low, very quiet, and seem to be very large. At this time, I became nervous, because I knew that what I was watching was not of the norm. Then I got back in my car and followed it for a minute, but then it seem to vanish from my view. It really could be very hard to realize it was there unless you were looking at there at the right time, but once I realized that this was definetly a moving object, it really kind of scared me, because of the size and the whole thing.",

Pic taken in Az\n\r\nReported by: Bob - New York - June 9, 2000, at 16:37:22 - Photo of object UFO Sighting - Lake Havasu, AZ - Date: 05/27/00 - Time: 4:30 PM EST Additional Information: Photo of UFO: Realized after taken back to home in NY Witnesses: ?? - Objects Shape: Unknown - Number of objects: 1 Event Description: I was on vacation in Lake Havasu AZ (to a big Mardi Gras type of party) on a sand bar of Lake Havasu (part of Colorado River)...Memorial Day weekend year 2000.\n\r\nI took many pictures while there with regular disposable cameras, as well as with my new digital camcorder &amp; new 3.3 mega pixel digital camera. The picture was taken on Memorial Day weekend (not sure was likely on Saturday maybe Sunday), but I did not so realize until after I downloaded it from my camera to my CPU hard drive..even then  it was two days later, I realized what was in the picture.\n\r\nThis looks like no plane or helicopter I know of or any other flying craft I am aware of. There was at a time a helicopter was around, but helicopters look nothing like what I caught on the photo. More than anything, I am looking to see if this is a \"flying saucer\" of some type or if it can be explained as something else. I already tried blowing up the photo on my CPU (have original compact flash card untouched since realizing what I may have captured) and it does not look like a balloon or anything like that.\n\r\nI can email a copy (digital cameras are great) to a lab or facility to try to authenticate it. Please advise how I can determine what I have in the picture.... Thanks, Bob I had reported this to the site mystical uneverse.com i since realise they r not perhaps the best to have reported this for proper study.\n\r\ni ofcourse have the original picture &amp; have not nor will i ever erace the compact flash card i took the picture on.\n\r\nthe site i posted the picture on used to show the whole picture..but now a year later they only show a small portion of the pic..the way they show it now,one can not get full perspective of the object..\n\r\nif wanted i can email a unedited copy.\n\r\nto do so is hard..for is a extremly large file uncompressed.\n\r\nplease do not ask me to send the compact flash card..i refuse to do so.\n\r\nif needed i can get a copy of it made(i will not allow thge original out of my posesion..\n\r\nanother weird thing is that a couple of months later..while back on the east coast..i also seemed to have captured a weird object on my camcorder(in NJ on the beach).\n\r\nthe implication of seeing 2 UFOs like that in such places so far away is a bit disturbing to me..i was not able to catch the second sighting as clearly as my 1st picture..\n\r\nalso after the 1st sighting there were a couple of helicopters aftyer it left...seems was not far from area 51 (as i have since learned)\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We will request to see a copy of the photo.

The first object appeared to be fairly close and had a beam of light barely visible coming from the front of the object.  The second UFO appeared shortly after I spotted the first one.  They were very intensely bright, a silver color, so there was no way to distinguish a shape.  To the eye they appeared like a round cluster of with tenacles of light protruding from all sides that hung down at the ends as if they were heavy, like a tree limb full of rain or snow.  The only thing I could relate it to is a decoration that one uses at a party to hang from the ceiling that has many short pieces that hang at downward angles when unfolded and hung.  I lost sight of them at one point, but as I turned the corner and looked to see if i could spot them I could see one UFO had risen and was barely visible as an eerie glow in the clouds.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke to this witness, and we found her to be quite credible and convincing.

I only noticed the object after the film from the vacation was developed, and even then, it took about 3 or 4 times looking at the photos to even spot it.\n\r\nThere is only one object in the photo.  It is positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the picture of rock formations and the almost full moon.  It appears to be  disk shape with the faint appearance of a dome.  It appears to be gray or silver in color.  It appears to have some type of illumuniation around the circumference.  There were no sounds that caught my attention while taking the photo.  The sky was very clear, without any clouds, and it was nearly dark.  The weather was warm and comfortable.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We have requested a copy of the photo.  PD",

It was about 8:45pm, I was waiting to close the shop at 9:00pm. Watching the sky which was hazy but clear enough to see stars. There was a light layer of clouds coming from the west out of California. I suddenly caught a glimps of somthing flying over my head. I looked up to see a group of three reddish/orange, some what bright yet fuzzy looking lights flying at what seemed to be couple of hundred feet above my head but completely silent. It travel at a very fast speed from east to west in the direction of Luke Air Force Base. It travel from above my head all the way across the sky to disappear over single story house across the 30 foot wide alley behind my shop. This took a total of about 6 to 8 seconds, just long enough for me to jump out of the chair i was leaning back in and shouted what the hell is that. My receptionist looked out the door and said \"what, what?!\" Just as it was passing over the top of the roof of the house. Then another person I work with ran out the back door and was asking what I saw. I was describing it to her and all of a sudden a boomerang shaped cloud traveling the same direction east to west, was moving across the sky at an extremely fast speed too. The other clouds that were in the sky never changed,they were in the same place as they were when the event started.",

When I returned outside the light (sort of a glowing round redish orange in color) was  on the ridge across from my house. This ridge is app. 1/2 mile from us and follows at a straight line with a full view of 5 miles in length ( we live in a rural area with no other lights around).\n\r\nThe sphere followed the ridge silently in the tree tops, sometimes in front of the trees, sometimes a little above, and sometimes it was behind them.\n\r\nThe trees here are oaks, bl. walnut, standing 50-60 ft. tall on the adverage.  As the sphere traveled it would stop, back up, and procede forward again.\n\r\nWe had our father come outside as well, he was somewhat of a sceptic on such matters, he watched with us and stated, \"well I know what it's not, it's not an airplane, or a helicoptor\" so he did decide it was unidentified.  We watched it for app. 20 min.\n\r\nAbout 1 &amp; 1/2 hours later I went outside again, and it had returned, following the same path as it had previously taken, doing the exact same thing, following the same ridge, very slowly, this time taking about 35 min.  We called a neighbor, about 1 mile away in that direction, and he had seen it the first time, but it was low for him and he thought it was a cars single brake light. He watched it as well the second time, only it was higher this time.\n\r\nHe told his wife, who had been traveling that night home from the same general direction of the light, and she stated that while traveling home she had observed several times, a light coming down from the sky onto the hills beside her, no sound, very fast, like a white search light going on and off.

It had been raining on and off all evening.  It was cold and miserable.  At approx. 0100 the rain stopped and the clouds cleared off.  At approx. 0130 one of our members who was facing the opposite direction from me muttered something like, \"Look at that star up there, it's moving.\"  Like a chorus from a choir, the profanity from that end of the camp sang out like Bocelli.  I jumped out of my chair to tell them to be quiet but to also see what the hell they were looking at.  I looked up and sure enough, there was a \"star\" that was moving around in the sky.  It moved up, moved down, moved side to side, got bright, dimmed completely and went back to bright again.  It also pulsated.  (This light was in the east) Shortly thereafter, another light of the same nature was spotted just several degrees to the right of the original moving light.  Shortly after that another light of the same nature was spotted several degrees to the right of the last.\n\r\nThese lights didn't seem to move great distances from their \"original position.\"  I think the first light may have been an exception to this.  At first it moved around in a small area but later moved around covering greater distances than the other two but then went back to just moving around in a small area.\n\r\nThese lights seemed to be using the backdrop of the stars as camouflage in that they A) typically only moved around in \"small\" areas and  B) moved with the stars as if to follow the earth's rotation.\n\r\nThis got redundant after awhile.  I believe I saw a 4th moving light later in the morning but didn't say anything to anyone.  This went on for the rest of the night/morning.\n\r\nThis was seen by all in the camp except for one person who is near sighted and doesn't wear glasses (go figure).  I'm very near sighted and have astigmatism but do wear glasses.  What's my point?  The first two lights were somewhat close to eachother.  Others seemed to be able to see more pulsating than me.  With my glasses off, these two very bright objects in the sky became very bright \"globs\" of light.  For once with my glasses off I could see something better than with them on.  The two lights were definately strobing/pulsating.\n\r\nI have spent a lot of time out in the woods at night but have never seen anything like this before.  For the first hour, we all stood around with our jaws hanging to our knees. After that we just got used to it and watched the ongoing show without saying much.\n\r\nI'm sure I left out some detail and would like to be contacted before this gets posted on your site.  I can best be reached in the evenings.\n\n<b>NUFORC Note:</b>We spoke with this witness, and he sounded sincere and eloquent in his description of the event.

They were dark in color but surrounded by a translucent cirle. by  Then the 747 started to turn south and the two smaller planes did an ariel loop-de-loop and ended up behind the 747.

We lived in the foothills of the Santa Catalina mountains of Tucson, along the southwest slope. I was coming through the trees between two houses to get to my back yard, when I looked up toward our house. The mountains can be seen directly over our roof from that position, about 3-4 miles away. Above the house, but between me and the mountainside were two blue halo-shaped phenomena that rose from about 20 degrees, straight up to about 75 or 80 degrees before winking/fading out. The closest comparison I can come up with is that of the paired exhaust ports on an F-4 Phantom. Two blue flame-like halos trailing to cones as they ascended. They were much larger than jet exhaust ports in scale though, from that distance. They rose above the level of the mountains, from my perspective, and still all I could see were the halos. No shape blocked out the stars where one would think a fuselage would have been. There was no sound whatsoever, and we were very used to the sounds of military aircraft, as Davis Monthan AFB in town is one of the largest AF bases in the SW.\n\r\nThis was no jet.

I was looking up at the sky, as usual, and I saw what I believe was a UFO. It didn't have any lights on it (that I could see) but I was still able to see it (very clearly) traveling across the sky, low to the horizon. It was kind of a dark gray in color. It was traveling from east to west. It was oval in shape, and appeared to be traveling at about the same speed a plane would, flying at a low altitude. Yet it appeared to be high in the sky. To get an idea of how big it was from my point of view, go out side, stretch your arm out and hold a \"quarter\" up to the sky, flat side facing you.

At this time I don't recall who actually saw it first; however, what I saw was basically triangular or \"an arrow\" in shape. It was heading in a Northerly direction. It had a series of lights on both sides (window shaped?)in two rows, over and under. They were somewhat rectangular.\n\r\nWhen it passed over (not directly over) I noticed the back had what appeared to be a series of lights moving towards the center from the outer ends. This was continuous. The underside (if memory serves) had I believe three lights. equally spaced.\n\r\nI also recall that it made no audible sound. At least non that we or I could hear. At first we thought it was some kind of a plane; however, once it got closer it became obvious that it was no plane that any of us had ever seen. We were also no where near an Air Force Base.

A distance of about 4 miles of country road.  We saw what appeared to be a chinook type helicopter hovering about 3-400 feet over a swampy area about 1-200 yards off the road.  An area I was quiet familiar with from hunting game in many times since my grandparents farm bordered this area on the North.  I remarked to my wife that this was indeed strange to see this sight and couldn't imagine what it could possibly be doing hovering there.  We got up opposite the craft on the highway, a somewhat remote country road and came to a halt.  We could clearly see what appeared to be rows of window lights and some colored lights like aircraft normally have at night (red etc).  I shut off the engine and lights and asked my wife to lower the window.  She complied and then the hair stood up on my neck because there was absolutely NO noise from this hovering craft 200 yards away.  I was shocked.  My military familiariety with helicopters told me that what we were seeing was definately real, and not a helicopter.  We were scared at what the craft might be, thinking UFO all the time.  I started the truck, peeled out, all the time my wife keept an eye on the craft.  We were only about 1/2 mile from our house and had a clear view even as we got out and into the house. I looked out of the East window of the kitchen, still viewing the craft and  I immediately called my parents who would be in direct line if the craft moved Easterly which it began doing. My parents ran outside of their house to see it but saw nothing.  It moved slowly Easterly for a few seconds then disappeared and was not seen again. We were all shaken by the event, and I to this day.  My mother related a story of a UFO sighting in that same general area that occurred when she was younger and living on the farm adjacent to our actual sighting.  The cows on my grandfathe! rs farm were frightened out of their wits by a craft seen by my grandfather when he went to the pasture to get them for milking.  Normally they would be at the barn on their own wanting to get milked but this day were scattered and bellering like crazy.  Grandfather never wanted to talk too much about what he saw that day except to say it was one of those UFO's.  Coincidence, anybody's guess.<b>NUFORC Note:</b>Date of event is approximate.

They observed from door windows an orange (fire-colored) sphere, appearing about 3 feet in diameter, floating noiselessly about 4 feet above the ground, approximately 150 feet from their observing location.  The sphere was floating near a water well located behind a building in their property and in front of a wooded area; no light sources are installed at that location, and lights from the state highway at the front of the property do not penetrate that area.  The denseness of the woods and the slope of a hill behind the sighting location precludes the possibility of neighbor's lighting sources being the source of this light.  The observers watched the sphere for approximately one hour, as it shifted position within about a 10-foot area, including changes in elevation of about the same range, continuing to make no sound.  After about an hour, the sphere slowly faded into nothing.\n\r\nThe observers are both keen observers of weather and surroundings, coming from farm backgrounds and being avid watchers of wildlife in their backyard and adjoining woods.  They both describe the sphere as looking like a full autumn moon, except their was no full moon at the observation time and the sphere clearly illuminated only the surrounding buildings and trees.  Neither observer felt that the light was a flashlight, and found no indications of trespassers after daylight.  Submission of this report by son of observers.",

While in my backyard, I saw a commercial aircraft going overhead apparently only moments after take off from the local airport. I glanced up at the plane and noticed, in the blue sky at a much higher altitude, a star like object. Had the plane not passed over, I probably would never have noticed the object. It looked like a star of average brightness, but this was 1 in the afternoon, and the only object of its kind visible. The object moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps slightly southwest. At one point, the object abruptly changed its course and moved south for about one minute. Then it once again resumed its westerly course. As I said, the object moved at what appeared to be a very low speed and was at high altitude. While watching, I observed two high flying commercial jets flying over Memphis, apparently bypassing the city enroute to other destinations. These planes were leaving contrails, but appeared to be at a lower altitude than the object. They were also moving at a considerably higher speed than the object. At one point the object came to a dead stop in the sky. It appeared to hover over what appeared to be the center of the city for at least ten minutes. It was absolutely stationary. It then resumed its westerly course. There were no erratic manuevers or sudden changes in speed other other than the 10 minute period of hovering and the brief change of direction to the south I mentioned. The object moved in straight lines. I ruled out a balloon figuring winds at such an altitude would have driven the object across the sky at a much faster rate, and balloons tend not to hover and remain stationary for ten minutes at a time. The entire sighting lasted aproximately 30 minutes and the object could not have covered more than 45-50 degrees of arc in the sky during this time. It did not appear to emit light of its own. It reflected sunlight and the intensity of the reflection varied as it moved across the sky. I am not a trained observer, but if this object was indeed as high as I thought, flying higher than airliners bypassing Memphis, it must have been  a rather large craft based on the intensity of the reflection. I followed its course with the naked eye until I lost sight of it as it moved into the path of the sun.",

His house sets on a little hill overlooking a small town 5 miles north. We stood on his concrete basketball court and fratenized in the cool missouri air. I looked to my east, northeast,above the horizon was a pink, wispy, cloud superimposed on the blue night. It was like a light but not, it was like a paintbrush stroke but not.  It was large, i estimate it to be around the size of 30 full moons, speaking of the moon it was directly opposite the pink anomali. As any young 21 year old of average intelligence might gather, \"this must be the northern lights\". It was beautiful  whatever it was and it held our full attetion for its duration. But here's the clincher about 3 minutes into the sighting a red pulsing light caught our attetion, due north, toward the town. The light seemed to be between us and the town, but closer to the town of some 14,000. It was red, stoplight red,and its lights never toataly went out, but dimmed and brightened in a methodial pattern, bright 1000 dim 1000.i estimate its size at 1/10 the moons. As the round light, as i could make out no shape of a craft, moved east toward the wispy pink anomali they both seemed to slowly disappear. That was it and they where gone. Sound u ask. Yes we heard a sound even befor the sighting, we thought it was a jet overhead, but it seemed to linger, who knows if they're  connected.  I have no idea if the red pulsing light was connceted to the pink discoloration. I've had a couple more sightings, none this intresting. My friend can backup all this 100%.

Then that's when I also noticed there was another object below the helicopter. The object seemed to be moving in a very fast circular motion making a whipping sound. The object appeared to be thin, small and white colored about the size of a small compact car with a red light on top.  The FWPD helicopter appeared to be observing this one object with curiousity at a close distance. As I watched in amazement I noticed that this object moved within a 3 block radius at the speed of a few seconds. This went on for about an hour and a half. As I left my friend's apartment headed southbound for home, object still in motion, after about 4 blocks distance the strangest thing that I noticed was after all that time no one else seemed to have noticed the event other than myself and 2 other friends.  Oddly enough, a month later in November I was at home with my son asleep in bed when I was waking up from my sleep I heard soft whispers that sounded like \"He is waking up\", when suddenly I was struck by a jolt of electricity on the right side of my ear and as I opened my eyes I saw a bright flash and I heard an electrifying, popping sound.  After this I must have passed out for about 30 minutes and I woke up feeling very nauseated and weak as if my energy had been sucked out of me. A few days later I discovered on the back of my ear a red mark which looked like a spider bite. Whenever I would touch the mark it was sensitive to the touch and it felt like to me that my head would explode!

This man had previously appeared on a talk show discussing his daytime experience that occured at his home in Cleburne, Texas.  He had videotaped an object similar to the one I saw in October hovering over hi! s stable s.They disclosed on the show that this videotape was in no way altered.  I'm led to believe that there might be a connection in our stories about this object.",
