I drove home and immediately told my friend what I had seen.

It was streaking southwest across the sky at an incalculable speed. It had an elongated greenish-blue or turquoise-colored contrail streaming behind. The contrail seemed to dissipate, fade-away slowly. My first thought was that I was witnessing a nuclear missile headed down and I became terrified. I stopped dead in my tracks to watch it. Then very quickly, almost instantly, the craft dropped down over the top of where I was standing. It made no sound. It stopped and hovered above me, maybe 20 feet above the ground. It was indescribable, the best I can describe it: metallic, saucer-shaped, surrounded by a turquoise-colored glow, and it had windows. I could see a being looking down from the craft, and the being appeared to raise a hand as if to wave at me.\n\r\nWithin seconds, dozens of people started running toward me. They were yelling and calling out \u201cwhat the hell is that thing!\u201d As they got close to me the craft instantly shot up straight and then streaked off about 1000 yards heading northwest, it flew just over the top of a hill, then it suddenly stopped and began to hover over a basin. A shaft of turquoise-colored light came down from the bottom of the craft down to the ground. By now I joined the others in a jeep and we drove fast as possible to the top of the hill to get a look at what it was doing. We got to the top of the hill and saw the turquoise-colored shaft of light was still coming down from the bottom of the craft onto the floor of the basin. It continued to hover for a good long while, maybe 15 minutes. Then suddenly the craft shot straight up into the sky until it disappeared from sight. The shaft of turquoise-colored light then slowly faded-out. The craft made no sound, but we could feel a strange vibration in our bodies. I was so frightened it sickened me. For a moment I truly thought I was going to die that very night. To this day I am disappointed with myself, because I never expected to be so terrified by a UFO.\n"

Despite this, the drug had not had enough time to take effect, and I am confident we all saw what we saw.\n\r\nTwo friends and I were going to break into this abandoned cabin on top of the mountain and spend the night. We all took a tab of acid at the bottom, and started walking.\n\r\nAfter about 10-15 minutes of hiking, I remember noticing flashes of lights in the corner of my eye. We had flashlights to navigate the dark, so I didn't think much at first, assuming I was just seeing our own lights.\n\r\nThe light would shine like a spot light, piercing a small area, and moved light a search light. It was almost like those lights at a movie premiere or something. It was intermittent and inconsistent, happening at different times, with different amounts of beams each time.\n\r\nWe kept walking and I ignored it. I thought maybe I was just seeing things. I didn't feel like I was tripping yet but I blamed it on the acid at first\n\r\nWe walked for about 5-10 minutes more before coming to a quick stop. We each caught our breath, drank some water, and one of my friends starts playing with his ken dama (Japanese ball toy). He lands a couple tricks, all whole this lights are strobing here and there. I ignored it and just watched my friend play, landing some nasty tricks.\n\r\nBut one particular strobe hit us just the right way, and I noticed my friend stop for a second and look up in the direction the light came from. That's when I asked if anybody else had been seeing these lights.\n\r\nAs soon as I said something, we all excitedly started to repeat each other.\n\r\nWe had all been seeing these lights and ignoring them, thinking it was either our own flashlights or just apart of the high, yet none of us felt as if we were tripping yet.\n\r\nWe turned off our flashlights, and the strobes continued.  They came from all different places, but all in about the same direction, we didn't have to turn our bodies to watch them all, coming from the west of us if I remember correctly.\n\r\nWe sat and watched for about 5-10 minutes before they're seemed to stop. We all still felt sober. We continued our walk but didn't see anything out of the ordinary.\n\r\nWe finally got to the abandoned cabin about 20 minutes later. It was about this time I felt the drug start to kick in.\n\r\nWe spend the night in the cabin without anything strange happening, but none of us still know what we saw.\n\r\nThe next morning we left the cabin. While hiking down, we heard the distant sound of a snow mobile. My one friend (who's idea it was to stay at this cabin) prompted us to hide.\n\r\nWe jumped to the side of the trail and waited as the snowmobile neared. It was a neighbor of my friend.\n\r\nThe cabin, as it turned out, wasn't truly abandoned. It still the property of a friend of the neighbor on the snow mobile. The neighbor checks in on the cabin from time to time while out riding. We hoped he would drive on by this time, as we had left quite a mess from the previous night.\n\r\nAs we get back to my friend's house, we hear the snow mobile coming back down the mountain. My friend prompted us to run.\n\r\nI had no idea where in the woods I was so I stayed behind my friend like my life depended on it. I had no idea where our other friend went but he sprinted the opposite direction\n\r\nWe ran till we got back towards the road and his behind a trailer quickly. My friend that I had followed just the noticed that out other friend wasn't with us. As soon as he asked where he went, we heard someone scream \"HEY YOU THERE\".\n\r\nInstantly my friend got up to continue the run home and I followed without hesitation.  We made it back to his house and ran up to his room. I was gonna grab my car keys (which I had left in his room) and go drive around looking for our friend, but he showed up before I made it out the door.\n\r\nOut of breath, we excitedly recount what had just happened thinking we had gotten away, but the neighbor had was able to track the prints in the snow back to the house.\n\r\nFrom the room we watched him turn around and go to his home, unsure what his next move was. We started to plan for the rest of the day when we saw two State Troopers drive down the road to the neighbors house.\n\r\nOnce again, without hesitation, I got out of there. My and the kid that ran the opposite direction left our friends house. I dropped him off at his house, went back to mine, and fell asleep.\n\r\nWhen I woke up, I was told that the friend we had left had gotten arrested for Trespassing.\n\r\nHere's the weird part. When he was taken in and questioned, they asked about the lights. From what he told me they wanted to know if we were the ones shining the light, or if we even saw it. From what he told me, he denied seeing or knowing anything.\n\r\nBefore being brought in he told his mom and dad what we saw, and they told him not to say anything about it. His father had told him that he had seen similar lights in the Mount decades ago.\n\r\nOver 5 years later, I still have no idea what we saw"

There were 5 lights spaced out and seemed to reconfigure to 3 into a shape of a triangle. Then they proceeded to form a straight line. At this point there were 4 lights.

I turned to walk towards the gate, facing southwest towards San Diego Harbor and noticed what appeared to be a meteor falling in the sky. It was very bright and falling more slowly than I would have imagined a meteor to fall and I kept staring at it in awe as it continued its decent in the nights sky. I had watched for about 30 seconds and yelled to my neighbor who was also walking her dog to look up in the sky. She asked, \"what is that?\" and I began filming as best I could. The tail of fire had begun to descend beyond my line of sight due to the tree line ahead but just as it neared the tops of the trees, the fire separated out into 5 rays of falling light and then began moving into a more horizontal formation which clearly became 5 separate hovering orbs of light. 4 of the orbs began moving west across the harbor and 1 orb can be seen moving west and then shifting towards the east. I ran down the street to get to a place with an unobstructed view of the harbor and only one orb remained for a brief moment before disappearing towards the south. I have captured 2 videos depicting what I saw. The first video is the very tail end of the meteor like fiery formation falling from the sky and you can see it separate out into 5 separate lines. The next video captures the 5 hovering orbs, right above the tree line as it began to descend lower over the harbor and then finally disappear. In the first video, you see the fire/light and hear my neighbor exclaim, \"Okay...it's breaking up now.\" In the second video, it immediately starts with showing the 5 separate orbs and then I ran down the street and the video is poor but when you get to the last 00:30 seconds left you see one remaining orb over the harbor and I exclaim, \"there it is\" and then it quickly disappears.<div id=\"museai-player-8c91f3996dc6074a0b5bc9c96caf9cf5\"></div><script>MusePlayer({container: \"#museai-player-8c91f3996dc6074a0b5bc9c96caf9cf5\", video: \"9aQvM5E\", width: \"640\", links: 1, logo: 0, search: 0, autoplay: 0, volume: 50, title: 0, style: \"full\", start: 0, loop: 0, resume: 0, align: \"\", coverPlayPosition: \"bottom-left\", cta: \"\", css: \"\", subtitles: \"\", locale: \"\", download: 0, playlist: \"\"})</script><div id=\"museai-player-204920e749f140890a3267ea5db5074d\"></div><script>MusePlayer({container: \"#museai-player-204920e749f140890a3267ea5db5074d\", video: \"tEegE9K\", width: \"640\", links: 1, logo: 0, search: 0, autoplay: 0, volume: 50, title: 0, style: \"full\", start: 0, loop: 0, resume: 0, align: \"\", coverPlayPosition: \"bottom-left\", cta: \"\", css: \"\", subtitles: \"\", locale: \"\", download: 0, playlist: \"\"})</script>"
