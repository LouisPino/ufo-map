There were a few whispey clouds around but mostly clear skies. The object, more or less, kept it s position. I stopped next to ((name deleted)) house as it had a good vantage to the North where the object was still in sight. I pulled out my video camera and started shooting video . The object then started to move away from my position I did my best to pull it in and get a good shot of it but up close the lense just blew out the image with light. IT did not make any noise and from my vantage it just scooted down into the tree line so I could not see it any longer. I was literally in the middle of the road in the dark so I left the scene.

I can\u2019t remember where we were going or what we were doing (we didn\u2019t date for very long), but I remember being in the passenger seat of his car driving down a dark road around 11:30 at night. Then I looked to my right once the trees parted and saw this circular string of lights hovering in the distance over a field or neighborhood. It looked like it was only a mile or so away, but not was a foggy night so it wasn\u2019t especially clear. I snapped a quick picture to verify what I was seeing and show my boyfriend, but I didn\u2019t think much of it after that.

According to moon schedule it should have been a new quarter only right side showing. I have video on my ring camera. Besides this a small white orb floats down parallel. Also have odd lights for at least 3 consecutive nights and saucer craft that can only be seen on video. The moon like object could be seen. At first it simply appeared and as it moved right it seemed to change shape and illuminosity around its edges but staying roughly round. I need to screen record my Ring footage.

I was excited to see the object when it emerged at the edge of the cloud. When it reached the end of the cloud, there was nothing there. I did not see a round object anywhere else in the sky. I did notice a kind of invisible pulse or something a split second after the circle reached the edge of the cloud. The circle was dark grey and perfectly round. It did not change shape and was silent. At approximately the same time the circle was about to reach the edge of the cloud, I noticed a passenger jet underneath the cloud flying from East to West. The circle was approximately a third bigger than the jet."

On our way down South Main St in Seymour CT (the road VBS is on) my fiance is driving and I'm sitting in the passenger seat of our silver 2014 Toyota Camry with our windows half down while we smoke a cigarette. It was a clear fall night with unusually warm weather for this time of year in CT. We are traveling North on the street towards the town of Ansonia. The left hand side of the road has houses and the right side of us has the Naugatuck River running parralel to the road. Out of no where I noticed an enormous shadow engulf the street in front of our car and at the same time my girl also notices this which forced us to look up to see what is creating this. At our surprise amazement and just pure shock and awe we see a flying rectangular craft the size of a large parking lot silently glide just over the tree tops in front of us coning from the left over the houses then cross the road exiting over the Naugatuck River to the right. It was traveling very slow and we were able to watch it for about 15 seconds before it disappeared over the ridge on the other side of the river heading in the direction of the town of Oxford. The craft seemed so low that I thought it was possible to hit it with a rock maybe 100 ft above the trees. The craft did not seem shiny or smooth but instead looked like a dull dark gray metallic color with lots of right angles and detail to the craft. It had very faint white lights positioned under the craft the I could only discribe as being like licence plate lights. They were so faint that you would not notice them if the craft was higher and were only noticed upon us looking up to inspect the ship. With us having our windows half down we were unable to hear any type of sound coming from it. It was as silent as a balloon floating through the air and even seemed to float like a balloon in its movement not slowing down or speeding up just gliding. I thought of trying to find my phone and record it but we where in such shock and amazement at what we where currently viewing that I was afraid I would miss it and not have enough time to achieve video proof unfortunately. At least I had my girlfriend with me who witnessed the same encounter. We were not using alcohol or drugs and we were not impaired in any way. I also thought it was strange that we were the only car traveling on South Main St at the time of the encounter as it was only 645 pm amd was only dark for an hr or 2 and the weather was clear. There are usually many cars on this street at this time but its not uncommon to have a break between cars for a few minutes. This was also a residential area with many houses close together and a some what dense population of people. I never heard anyone else mention seeing this or any news reports about this but I did hear of a story that happened around the same time in Oxford CT the next town over that was the direction the craft was heading. I read on the News app NewsBreak that a lady in Oxford was sitting in her car in her driveway at around 10am when a creature that resembled at 4 ft tree with legs that ran extremely fast in front of her car across her driveway and into the woods. I do not know if these two sightings are related but I do think it is possible seeing that it falls in the same time frame and geographical area."

            "characteristics": "Emitted beams, Missing TimeVery large fat Cylinder craft close to my location\n\r\nThis happened just as the small stores were starting to open up after covid but they had installed plastic widows between you and the cashier. I'm guessing 2021, I came out of convenient store got to my car and looked up towards north and this very large dark grey, very fat cylinder with smaller cylinder attached at top was sitting under large white puffy cloud. It almost looked like dark whale skin. Very smooth with no sharp edges. Like a big can without sharp edge, bottom not straight across but slightly shallow bowl shape. Its was a beautiful clear day with large puffy clouds in the sky. I was kind of at an under it angle so only saw bottom, side and the small edge of the top cylinder part. A bit taller than its diameter but not much. I had thrown my purse into car before I noticed it and did not want to dive in to get cell phone since this item was moving up towards the cloud slowly. \n\r\nI decided to just watch. It was quite large but I could not tell exactly size or distance until I drove back out there in the afternoon and noticed how small a little airplane looked compared to this cylinder craft. It could have held 7 airplanes ( 10 passenger size plane) stacked on top of each other inside easily. I looked for any kind or rivet, window, antennae, flange etc sticking out from it but saw nothing. It was quite smooth. I was getting a very strong glare off of the craft but very rhythmically. I thought it might have something that the sun hit that blinded me. I had to close my eyes a bit longer than a blink because it was so bright but again was on and off rhythmically. The sun was already up low in the east probably around 8:15 am so thought the craft might be slowly spinning but saw nothing that Sun would glare off of. So I could not tell if it was spinning. I did not notice where the strong glare was coming from the craft. I glanced around what is usually a very busy shopping center and saw no cars or people anywhere. \n\r\nI kept looking for another witness. The Campbell 3 lane road which has a light at the corner had no cars which is very odd its always very busy night or day. No people or cars at gas station, drug store, barbecue place, car wash, shopping strip, dog walking area. Even the store I just came out of had no one behind the counter anymore. I watched this craft which had no lights, no windows and I could hear no sound. I tried very hard to listen for a buzz but it might have been to far up. I don't think I heard any sound, not even birds etc. It slowly moved up into this puffy white cloud. I waited knowing at about the speed it was going up it would start to come out the top of the cloud. I waited quite an extra while and it did not exit the top of cloud. I smiled and knew it was not coming back out. I tried to figure out distance in that if it headed down towards the ground where would it land and I thought it might hit the water tower in our neighborhood only a few streets over. \n\r\nNo one in this busy neighborhood saw anything. No one posted anything. In fact I felt like I was the only person in this town while I was watching and that started to freak me out. Its a very lonely feeling. Did not see any cars when I drove home which was only a few blocks away. I was very blah about it, mentioned it to family member , but for some reason I had no excitement, and they ignored me. I immediately wrote down date time and a drawing of my sighting in my notebook. That information seems to be missing. I am upset that I didn't pay more attention to the time it took me to go there and get back home. Starting to think I was taken out of time. Also it was quite a while till I mentioned it again to family members and dont know why. Wonder if the glaring light was giving me some information I don't yet know.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://nuforc.org/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845/PA201490-fb794de72698955a0709b5f8f280da20.jpg\"/>"

I called my husband who was at our home about three minutes away- he went outside and saw them as well and was confused as to what they might be. I first contacted a local news station who replied to my submission but that was all I heard from them. Then I posted to instagram to see if anyone could suggest what they were- people seemed just as confused as me. I posted to the Next Door app to see if anyone else saw it, not one person. I then called the Riverside Sheriff to see if they had info or anyone had reported it and they had no information.

Around 6:00 am I went upstairs and looked out through the blinds and saw 2 bright lights moving very quickly coming towards my house from the north.

They were moving very fast and went behind the cloud at a high rate of speed. I clicked on my  sky app looking for starlink satellites because I thought this must be what I just saw, but from what I understand starlink satellites do not move extremely fast, nor are they blue, but there were no starlinks displaying on my screen moving in this direction. These were distinctly blue and we're moving rapidly, so rapidly it made me think of a weapon being fired that leaves a trail of light behind it. They were coming from the west and headed east and I caught them while I was glancing up to see a storm headed up from the southwest and there are some lightning flashes down there. And I could just barely see the moon behind the clouds due south of these objects. If they turn out to be starlink satellites I apologize but I can't imagine that they were. The gap in the clouds that I saw these through, was as wide as the space created when I hold my arm at full length toward the sky, and splay my fingers outward, from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. They were very, very small points of bluish light, looking like nothing I've witnessed before."

Looking South down the road, I could see the usual street light in the far distance. Glancing up, I noticed two bright pulsing balls of light just above the horizon or tree line. At first, I didn\u2019t think much of it, but then noticed the lights were much larger than anything I\u2019ve seen before, and they were slowly ascending and getting smaller in the night sky. Regrettably, I had a dog pulling me by leash in one hand and a flashlight in my other hand. I wanted to get my mobile phone out to take a picture or video, but it all happened so fast. Within 30 seconds or so, the glowing or pulsing bright white lights rose higher into the atmosphere and then suddenly, there was a starburst flash a bit higher and to the right of them and they both disappeared. This may sound stupid, but it was almost like something out of Star Trek when the Enterprise goes into WARP speed and disappears. To be honest, it looked identical to what they captured on video during the filming of The Secrets of Skinwalker Ranch. I don\u2019t recall the exact episode, but there was a single white pulsing orb that disappeared with a similar starburst effect. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my entire life, but they were clearly not airplanes or any other objects I\u2019ve see in the night sky. My biggest regret is not dropping the flashlight to get out my mobile phone to capture photographic or video evidence of the event."

It is simply a stationary illuminated object.\n\r\nI was on the balcony of my 27th floor condo (on the beach), which looks to the west, where I often enjoy a sunset. One evening, I observed a stationary light to the SW, making it unusual for the busy airspace. Would have said it's a helicopter, except there was no noise. While sitting on the balcony, helicopters can often be heard at a range up to 5 miles. Made a brief video with my iPhone 12 to look at later. Then forgot about it, until a week or two ago; I went to clear out my iCloud storage of old videos and photos. Took another look at it, and after zooming in, it became apparent it was not an approaching aircraft landing light. It showed a polyhedral shape to it, and seemed to show an opal like color that shifted and pulsed, but remained stationary. After enlarging, there were no apparent red or green aviation position lights. The camera seemed to retain approximate focus with the contrail remnant in the far background.\n\r\nI would estimate the light/UAP was maybe 3 or 4 miles east of the KFXE Fort Lauderdale Executive airport, the light being approximately 3 miles away to the South West from my position, and FXE being 6 miles away to the WSW. My ballpark estimate on the altitude would be about 2500 ft, which would be very unusual for known aircraft...the airspace boundary between FXE tower and Miami Approach/Departure is right at 2400AGL... as I have often flown out of FXE on IFR flight plans, I know that they do not assign aircraft that boundary altitude...it would create confusion as to which controller had that target. While aircraft often climb or descend through that altitude, they would not appear stationary. I did not call FXE tower, as I noted nothing unusual until some 20 months later. (Didn't bother to look at the video in detail for some time.).\n\r\nI am a retired Navy CDR (O-5), an ATP rated pilot with + 17,000 hours in some 60 types of aircraft. I am a retired major airline pilot, and have flown scheduled passenger service out of FXE airport. I also keep my twin engine Piper Seneca nearby and often fly in this airspace.\n\r\nThis is my 4th observation of something strange, that I could not explain.\n\r\nI am also a former Field Investigator for MUFON (FL).\n\r\nI tried to upload the original format, but when exporting a video, Apple changes the format. If the upload isn't a full resolution view of the original video, please have someone contact me for a better way to upload. Would also appreciate someone with better video exam/enhancement skills to shed light on what this object may have been.\n\r\nTo me, without any other explanation, this remains a simple UAP.\n\r\nMy sources at MUFON tell me there were two other reports of \"Orbs\" within 24 hours of this sighting in other locations in SE Florida."

I was, for a second time today, walking laps around my backyard to stretch my sprained left hip muscle, which is why I wasn\u2019t at work. Now what I\u2019m about to write might sound strange but considering this is my fourth or fifth sighting to leave me baffled, I\u2019ve actually come to expect these types of sightings in my every day life. Specifically in the San Gabriel Mountain area near Pasadena I\u2019ve witnessed dozens of craft that may very well be balloons of some sort since most that I see travel extremely slow and reflect the sun\u2019s white light to appear like stars in the middle of the day.\n\r\nAs I paced in my backyard and turned to face the mountains, a dim gray-colored craft flying west to east caught my attention for some reason. It seemed to be at or above 30,000 ft traveling as fast as a plane, but I like to test things now by \u201ctransmitting\u201d a telepathic thought out; something along the lines of, \u201cIf you can hear me, stop and reverse course.\u201d I then used a helpful technique of finding a nearby tree branch as a reference point to not lose sight of crafts flying through cloudless skies. I followed this first plane-like object with my eyes, taking small steps toward my left to keep it in my sight as it flew eastward. Then it stopped mid-flight and I immediately thought, \u201cOf course, another balloon about to drift in a new direction.\u201d Then for the next 3 to five minutes it remained stationary, and gradually grew so faint that I lost sight of it.\r\nNothing spectacular, but I\u2019ve learned the hard way that an initial disappearance does not signal the end of the experience. Patience is key. I scanned the same area of the sky for another couple of minutes before a craft reflecting or emitting bright white light at the same altitude and speed of the first came into my view. \u201cMust be a plane,\u201d I thought as it approached the spot where the first craft had vanished. Suddenly the second UAP begins circling that very spot in the sky. I\u2019ve never seen a plane exhibit bird-like behavior and make full tight circles within a few seconds. My immediate thought was, \u201cNobody will believe this,\u201d since I had left my phone in the house and couldn\u2019t record video. As I became fully aware of what I was witnessing, the circling craft started emitting smaller white flares at different points perpendicular and outward of its circular path. I counted four flares in the first four \u201corbits\u201d and then it circled for at least another 3 or 4 loops before continuing eastward like a regular plane for one or two minutes before I lost sight of it behind the neighbor\u2019s tree.\n\r\nOf course, I \u201ctransmitted\u201d a message of thanks before I lost sight of it.\r\nI went back inside the house and on my laptop, visited RadarBox.com to look up any possible flight using the playback history feature but nothing stood out to me that matched what I had seen."

About half a mile away as we were approaching we noticed a very bright light on the ground in the field. Initial thought it was a fire in the distance, had an orange hue with an aura around it. It was almost a rectangular shape making us think it was a combine. As we approached it , it suddenly disappeared as if shutting down a combine or turning off head lights. The light lasted for about 10 seconds. When we passed the location there was no combine or farm machinery and no other vehicles or house. It was an empty bean field."

As I was driving I noticed a bright light that seemed to pulse red and white. I thought it may be a star at first and then maybe a cell tower on a mesa south of town but I could see sky below the light. It was too big and bright to be either. As I watched it, the light divided into 2 lights. The 2nd light was just to the left of the 1st at the same elevation and very near. The 2nd light then moved slowly back into the 1st and then back to the left. Then a 3rd light appeared just to the right of the 1st. The 2nd light moved back into the 1st and then they all blinked out. The second sighting was about 8 miles SW of Mountainair but it seemed to be in the same general area as the 1st sighting. It was just one light and it lasted for a few seconds.

I was woken by what appeared to be a tall alien humanoid in my bedroom with a smaller alien humanoid with human like facial features in my bedroom door frame. The larger entity immediately recognized i had woken and immediately seemed to cause my body to go still and laid me on my back down unto my bed. While doing so, it was as though it was trembling my head with a vibration to which it was able to paralyze me and control my movement and stillness. As it laid me back down on my bed, it stood over me, looking at me and i went to sleep as if induced anesthesia. To which I then woke in fear. Inability to sleep or have lights turned off ensued for the remainder of the night.\n\r\nTo this day I vividly remember the occurrence, have told very few people and still deal with mild fearfulness of sleep. I feel as if that night has changed me ever since. I have in the past dealt with actual occurrences of sleep paralysis, although this occurrence was entirely different in its vividness and wakefulness, to which I have never experienced since.\n\r\nThis occurred just outside my home town where I have also witnessed on multiple occasions, \"orb\" like UAP, golden/orange in color. In each case, they would either appear from nowhere in the sky, change size from large to small, hover and then fade out, or rise slowly from behind thick tree line in distance, hover and then recede back down beneath the distant tree line. These occurrences always happened in the night. Never have i seen them during the day.\n\r\nThe most recent sighting I've had of an \"orb\" shaped glowing UAP in that area was September 2022. Before that year I would often see them in the months of June, being the most active.\n\r\nI understand if this is not viable report for UAP, although I thought this would be a good place to share this experience in relations to the \"orb\" sightings I have had in that area. Very small rural town off the trans-Canada HWY17.\n\r\nWarren, Ontario. Now amalgamated as the municipality of Markstay-Warren."

The light started to descend and then moved 20 degrees above the horizon. Then it took off at an incredible speed going towards Kazakstan. This was definitely not the orbital station because it was way faster. It was probably 150 km in front of us."

We see airplanes/helicopters daily due to small airport close by and KCI being not too far. But in the last several weeks we have seen 3 or 4 separate ufos. The first was about 2 or 3 weeks before the latest last week.\n\r\nThe first was a bobbing light that would skip ahead suddenly then return to bobbing across the sky. We observed it for several minutes before it disappeared behind the roof. Seemed several 1000ft in the air.. Tried to take photos. But all 3 turned out as streaks on the camera phone\u2026\n\r\nThen last week I noticed an object moving fast about 2-300 ft off the ground going over our house.. Took me a minute to realize what I was seeing and pointed it out to my wife. It seemed to be an object or objects in a cloud of mist. It almost seemed to be changing shape or the mist was distorting the shape. No sound at all.\n\r\nWe sit on our back deck to smoke and are avid sky watchers. We have seen skylink and other satellites on several occasions.
